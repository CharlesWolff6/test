    我们召开7月份呢对通会，啊这个本次月度例会的主题是普惠金融的专题讨论。我为什么选这样一个主题？呢今天上午啊我们也参加了总行朱建行长召开的这个上半年的一个就是强大办公会，啊特别是总行行长办公会，还有我们相关的部门也参加。
00:00:29
    从这个会议过程当中，应该说大家充分感受到，啊应该说总行的高目标定位，更高的目标，更严的要求，啊还是同时要求这个更强的作用。啊我们也感受到啊总行这经营管理过程中面临着巨大的压力，啊按照我们图片上呢更多的可能要睡不着觉啊这种心态，啊尤其是我们对标同业的数据看，啊总行啊我们充分感受到啊总行呢应该领导还是比较焦虑，啊这种背景之下，啊我希望我们今天的这个普惠金融发展，啊我们这个专题讨论，啊需要我们各家行更加的务实，更加的积极。
00:01:30
    啊总行今天上午的会议，我觉得住建行实际上更多的是期待，因为也不能有任何松懈的思想，必须要真抓实干，干好三季度，啊可能因为三季度总行从零售的来说，有可能不负责任。啊因为压力很大，而我们今年看到主要同业对接银行，江苏银行、南京银行、宁波银行、
00:02:04
    杭州银行所有的指标的增速，包括民生啊都已经超过了10%。所以我们啊所以这种背景之下，啊全行要改变一种巨大的压力。啊第二个方面呢就是三季度啊应该说强调了全面的发展，更看重信贷啊我们资产业务的投放。啊所以这个普惠金融实际上也是我们啊资产业务的一个重头戏，啊尤其是我们三季度，啊我觉得是培养的重中之重。
00:02:41
    啊所以今天的这个总体来说，啊普惠金融的专题，我觉得各个行发言的时候，啊我觉得一个聚焦，聚焦什么普惠的可持续发展。第二个我觉得一个标准，这是我们对各个行评价的标准。就是一个你的普惠的占比，你的普惠的增速，啊我们更加好。
00:03:10
    啊其实我们现在都有一个这样的相关的数字，啊这样的数字总体来看，我们现在各家行呢带头呢这个在当地的同业的占比，南京地区啊是0.8，无锡地区是1.23，南东地区是1.59，常州地区是1.86，我们盐城地区是1.5升，每个地区实际上你的贷款在当地的占比是多少？我们有多少个行，我们是普惠在当地的，是低于我们的这个贷款占比，啊而且现在按照这个银保监局、
00:03:54
    江苏银保监局、上海银保监局啊对我们的要求，啊上海保监局对总行的要求，要尽快的达到普惠金融的战略是要达到10%。江苏银保监局上一周也跟我们讲，我们目前的普惠的占比在当地的所有城商行当中的排名，我们还是成立后三位。
00:04:20
    啊虽然我们是在稳步的前进，但是我们技术也不一样，啊所以这个占比是我们国家评价的唯一标准，啊包括你的增速，啊这是我觉得是一个标准。啊我也跟这个今天会议之前，我也跟这个叫什么小企业部说了，我说我们今年8年的材料主要是从4个角度，第一个呢是站在这个小企业部、审批部，包括我们的风险管理，更多的是站在分行中场部门的角度，谈如何去赋能，如何去推动，如何去有效的产品管理，还有一个更加有效的风险控制，啊这是中长部门的效果。
00:05:13
    第二个是站在经营单位的角度，我们更加强调的是因地制宜，啊因为现在可能小企业我可能也会搞，我们产品很多，现在可能大概有6大类产品，啊产品，啊但是我们每一个地区，我不要求各个行一定要全面开发，但是一些基本的产品，啊你必须要有一种触及，啊不能一个行的土规务的发展越来越干净，啊那是极度危险。啊所以我觉得是第二个我们强调的对标，我们啊今天上午啊我们相关部门参加总行的会议，啊就感受得到总行现在更希望我们各家行呃更高的目标定位，啊你要对标当地的同业先进，啊我们现在每一家，我们希望我们下面发言的时候，我们每家分行二级分行，你要对标当地的同业，看一看我们有没有差距，我们存在多大的差距。
00:06:26
    啊所以从今年上半年的数字看，因为到5月底的市场份额这个数字到6月底的市场份额数据没有，我们看了一下我们各个地区成本份额下降，是常规分管。啊就是我们5个地区，啊4个二级分行加1个南京地区，存款份额下降长度贷款份额下降，常州分行盐城分行。
00:07:07
    啊但是我们更要看到我们南通分行和无锡分行，啊今天这两天好像都可以发言，南通分行跟无锡贷款，普惠的占比可能在当地我估计是倒数第一，啊发展极其不平衡，所以我觉得希望大家呢就是我们二级分行的发言，啊因地制宜，对标管理队伍建设，啊这个方面可能重点有一点去聚焦。第二个第三个就是我们要站在什么角度，叫持续经营的角度，我们更多的要谈一谈如何实现普惠的综合化经营和专业话题。
00:07:52
    啊综合化经营更多的时候，我们不会啊如何，我们不能局限于为做普遍服务。按照我们的规划，今年年底我们的普惠的贷款余额就有望达到100，在我们800亿的对公贷款当中是一个相当大的比重。啊这个100亿应该给我们多所带来一些共性。啊我听响亮也把那个相关的数据做了一些分析，真的是令人担心。我们有时候平时可能想客户从哪里来，啊也是我们的零售客户，啊至少是我们零售的普惠企业900克都是我们的有效客户。
00:08:37
    我们怎么去抓联动？啊这个方面我也需要我们大家啊这是第3个方面。第4个方面我觉得还是要站在过程管理的角度，啊怎么去看一看推进我们普惠业务的高质量？高质量是两个，一个是发展的高质量可持续，第二个是业务的高质量，就是我的合规跟风险总体可靠。
00:09:08
    啊第二个我们讲的构成管理的第二个方面是高效率，啊这个也是给我们的中后台部门，不仅仅是对南京方面，包括我们2月份综合的部门，如何实现高效。啊第三个我觉得过程管理呢就是我们更多的要好的结构。啊前面也讲我们普惠业务的发展需要更加全面均衡的发展，可持续的发展。啊所以我希望我们各家行发言的时候，重点围绕这4个角度啊对你存在的问题啊做一些破解。
00:09:49
    啊今天的这个会议呢总体安排，呢首先是请小企业部啊作为一个专题的发言，然后呢请我们二级分行啊做教育，而且反而交流，呢因为今天还有一个请我们无锡分行对江阴支行啊开业近半年来，整体应用的推进作为一个重点，啊所以我这今天的这个发言的顺序，二级分行的顺序是请常州分行南通分行，然后营业部龙江支行江宁支行结束以后，我说第二个题目无极端，啊啊做两个方面做一些整体的发言。
00:10:32
    最后呢再请我们三位行领导，啊这个我们经常呢主要是站在如何保证我们普惠业务的合规，啊我们风险可控，业务合规的角度，推进我们以普惠业务的发展。啊我们主要呢更多的是谈我们普惠业务的联动，啊我们实际上呢这个重点是对如何继续加快为由的持续发展，啊持续增长。
00:11:11
    啊下面首先请小企业李行长，各位领导同事，我代表了小企业金融部做工作汇报，汇报的题目呢主要是聚焦普惠可持续和高质量发展，推动分行普惠贷款余额增长100亿。嗯汇报的内容主要是三部分，首先呢回顾一下上半年的一个经营情况，截止到6月末，分行普惠贷款余额呢达到了75.56亿元，较年初呢净增是20.63亿元，贷款占比呢提升到7.25%。呃上半年经营来看，7家经营单位呢基本完成呃目标就是我们续时啊进度又加了未完成其中的一家是负增长的。从经营单位经营来看，呢我们也发现一个规律，就是基数大的发展越快。我们的常州分行盐城分行在部署和余额呢仍然保持高增长，营业部呢建业支行呢就南京地区部署的余额呢远超趋势进一步的一个要求。从呃户数增长来看的话，这个我们也把泰州分行单独罗列了一下，为什么呢我们泰州分行现在在筹备上半年的竞争是户数竞争是18户，我们简单比较一下，就超过了5家经营单位，可能快赶上唉部分二级分行的一个部署的一个增长。
00:12:37
    从规模来看，呢研究发展的普惠余额呢近20亿，这个可能也是我们呃新的一个高度，啊建业集团的普惠余额是近5亿元，可能这两家呢作为我们二级分行和南京地区一个我们分行内部的一个标杆。嗯从两个产品来看，今年是把我们的宅基带和票据带两个产品的单列计划单列目标，咱现在余额呢突破就是突破20亿元。呃基本在我们跟审批部啊运营管理部各部门联合的情况下，呢我们现在宅基站产能每个月维持在一个亿以上，但是呢二级分行宅基贷业务呢发展仍然是只有常州分行完成了趋势进度，我觉得总结的原因嘛就是我觉得觉不够，办法不多。南京地区的宅基地贷业务发展较好，5家经营单位超续时进度的一个要求，我觉得这主要得益于这个宅基地专人专岗的一个成效，大家有人会安排一个专人去做，去沉下心去专门做这件事情，发现这件事也可以做得比较好。
00:13:44
    票一贷业务来讲，呢增量扩面的成效呢确实还不明显，主要还是依靠省担保，但现在我们其他项目像京东海洋啊综合啊都有突破，但投放不及预期，余额呢合计呢是13.54亿元，这里头当然还有两个亿的非普遍，这两个亿的非普遍非普遍的是去年遗留的问题，今年呢可以通过置换，可能我们这个也是两个亿的一个空间。南通、常州、泰州和龙江呢就在票据带上面有突破，这个业务呢就大家还是要去做。第二个方面呢就是普惠金融目前呢分行存在的一个主要问题。嗯总的来讲这两方面，第一个呢是分行普惠发展的已经进入攻坚期，规模是越来越大，这个可能规模是我们以前从来没有过的，指标的，总行的指标其实也是越来越重，这个双重叠加的，所以我们需要对一些短板问题呢尽快补足，才能支撑起后续快速可持续的发展。我们的发展呢也面临三个不匹配，领导总结的就是第一个呢是业务规模和队伍建设不匹配，可能我们到100个亿，如果说1个呃从同业来讲，如果普惠到100，没有一个专业化的一个队伍去配去配置去支撑，我觉得也是不合理的。
00:15:01
    第二个是发展的路径呢和可持续增长的能力不匹配，原来更多的是为了完成指标，啊我们的综合营销综合贡献和本地化的一个结合是不够的。第三个是综合化经营和专业化能力以及系统化的支撑呢也是不匹配。具体的4个方面，第一个就是普惠压力呢是越来越大，这个可能各家经营单位都能明显的感受到，我们部门呢我们也能感受到就是二级分行的完成难度也越来越大，原来这个这个是我们原来是不会存在的，就是二级分行完成相对容易一点，但是今年来看这个指标完成确实不容易。南京地区呢这两路径较为单一，普惠普惠部分普惠的专人专岗的，这个其实保护已经后面会有数据，也比较多了，普惠队伍的建设呢是刻不容缓，开会具体的介绍和另外的一个差距，呢弥补了像追赶其实也是比较难的，尤其我们在监管通报里边，就是我们在当地各地我们的规模和占比仍然是落后的，别的银行也在快速的增长。
00:16:03
    第4个就是业务结构也在优化，包括我们今年上半年的我们对国有对企业背景的业务来进行战略的进行严控，那二级分行我们希望二级分行呢在这上面形成一个业务依赖，在普惠制造业和科创的重点领域产品方案呢我们反正也在想办法去弄，还是进一步的这个明显是不足。下一页就是我们看一看我们各地，就包括我们全分行的整个分行和各地分行在同业一个占比的一个国会占比的一个比较，从数字这个我们我们的数字占比呢是6月末的，但是监管呢更多的应该是5月，5月的一个数字，啊大家可以看一下。我们几家包括南京，包括整个全分行，只有盐城和海龙5个占比是跟当地呢是基本持平的，其他地区呢其实差距还是比较大的，对吧？可能有的我们可能都不到平均的零头，呃差不多在0左右。
00:17:01
    所以我觉得二级分行呢也要把这个占比呢作为一个重要的一个攻坚目标，对制定好我们的自己各自的一个目标和计划啊提升的一个目标，什么时候能赶上统一的一个水平，这个是需要我们去啊制定的，比较有计划去研究的。因为这个占比呃虽然进进步比较快，但是呢跟同业的差距确实是难以弥补。第三个部分呢是分呃下半年普惠金融的一个工作的一个方向，1个首先呢是我们的目标，就是还是围绕啊李行长提到的4个方面，我们推动普惠金融可持续和高质量发展。在实现100亿目标的同时，呢为我们明年发展布局和它基础就是规模我们分为4个，目标规模、目标占比目标、产品目标，还有其他目标，这个是我们更多的一个呃定量的一个更多的定量一个指标。
00:18:01
    具体展开来说，第一个呢还是推动中产负能能力的提升。嗯第一个方面呢是加大产品创新和战略，产品的创新和优化力度，现在存在的问题，今年其实我们年初呢也做了一个规划，完成40亿是吧？就是当时也做了一个规划，包括改进贷票易贷、刹车分期是吧？还有一些新产品，从目前来看，这个可能我们部门我们做的唉也没有很好的去完成，啊就是说规划的商用车分期，我当时想可能做个10个亿的这个没能上线没能上线，这个可能跟市场环境也有关，对吧？包括跟这个合作方的一个需求，今年我们的新能源车的对吧？更热的是新能源车，传统的这个车辆也会受影响。我们年内的下半年的目标呢还是要上线1~2个新产品和项目，嗯工作的重点还是围绕我们全行各个分行大家都能使用的不适应的产品来开发，现在我们在进程中的素材带，呃信用贷和包括我们的信呃信科贷和工程信用贷的我们凤凰普惠啊要想支持每年的一个快速的发展，我觉得每年要上线一个10亿家的一个产品线或者是项目才能支持这个目标，这个呢是我们部门的更多的是我们部门的职责，我会围绕这个方向继续去努力。
00:19:25
    只有分行的现在的产品越来越多，但是对于整个产品体系的来讲还是不承担，所以发展部门我们也要签加大产品创新力度，不断不断的丰富我们的产品准备，在担保快贷、抵押快贷、产品快贷和信用快贷4个产品线产品这个在这个产品体系要尽呃尽量去加大我们产品创新，优化我们的产品流程，为经营单位能够提供普适性的，能更结合当地客群的这样一个产品。所以下面也是我们罗列的分行现在排的，就是我们部门排的，就是在现在可能在加快进度，啊有的我们是年内啊也是要还是要确保去上线。第二个方面呢就部门从我们部门来讲，要牵头做好大平台借渠道的1个工作，嗯牵头做好这4个亿的渠道，啊做好洽谈准入审批协调开发和运营的工作。这个4个渠道，呢嗯第一个是批量获客，这个刚刚也刚才也讲了就不多说了，就是包括我们最近环保在也要签协议，啊这里头呢涉及到很多的牵头主办团，我们也希望主办团呢能够顾全大局，在产品上呢能够有产品的全盘通用的对吧？我们能够全盘一起干。第二个呢担保公司这个渠道上面，前第一我们做过第一次担保公司白名单的集集中的一个营销的准入，啊但是现在看来能合作的也都全合作了。
00:20:47
    嗯我我们最近也在梳理了第二批担保公司的白名单，根据监管给了一个最新的一个评级的一个情况，我们也发现就盐城地区啊有12家，就本地的ab级的监管评级是ab级的，更多是国有担保公司太多呢有10家，这个是可以我觉得是第二批可以去经营单位去准入的，南京地区呢有4家已经陆续在我们已经陆续对接过了，我们也在写材料在准入。第二个呢就是可能还是我们部门要牵头重点的担保公司的一个激活，主要是省级的，一个是在保和省国信，应该省在保证我们现在跟子公司合作都很好，今年呢应该把在保这个额度呢能够使用起来。包括这个像国庆。第三个就是核心企业供应链这一块，呢就是经营单位呢还是要去会做这个票一带，今年就是在这个城内授信承兑人的模式呢在常州分行二季度有落地，家里呢我看也在报一个核心企业，嗯然后其他经营单位呢有几种模式都可以，还是要尽快的去学会用这个产品。第4个就是合作园区，就是园区我们也持续推动这个园区保的业务现在有落地，但是效果还不明显，也有突破，就是包括营业部在南京地区的，我们成成功推动了一个总队的签约，就不需要一个园区一个园区再去谈这样子，是百分比较大。
00:22:07
    第三个呢是从风险管理的角度来讲，呢我们希望呢是做好多部门的齐抓共管，齐抓共管的这样的一个呃抓这个合规呃和技术风险这方面。嗯全多个部门我们聚焦就严重多的部门聚焦重点产品环节领域的相关风险。嗯以前规模小，呢我们风险出的少，可能就是以前对这块强调的不多，这一次呢可能因为随着近期啊出现了一些状况，所以也出现一些分析，所以希望能够做好。啊分行主要都是股灾流动，但是你希望经营单位有大家能够认识风险，也必须怕风险，啊就是因为普惠的确实这个户数多，唉其实规模大的这个肯定会出，但是我们要坚守我们的呃底线就加快了。然后我们的篱笆我们也从这个几个环节，吧一个不会因为我们环节就是可能就是需要各个部门的一个流动，以及我们可能近期的一个重点的一个呃重点，在一些领域啊环节一些容易存在的风险。这里头简单的呃我再提一下就是近期可能就是大家需要关注的。第一个呢就是在从代销环节来讲，还是要严管获客来源，就是对客户经理的一些渠道可能就还是需要行领导也参与进去，也参与进去，就是说要了解这个渠道的一个真实情况。
00:23:27
    第二个呢就是确保尽调的有效性，我们也发生了就是什么呢？对这个房子房产就是这个禁用不够，就是败诉的一个情况的签署，前手可能就尽量尽量不要会导致这个我们的这个抵押权啊可能被判无效的。第三个就是婚姻婚姻状况的一个核实，啊重点呢是对我们这个国务院委员是离异的，就是这个借款主体就是离异的这样一种状况，可以通过呢前面我们也发了，可以通过支付宝或者苏服办去核实，如果还是查不到的，可能还是要求去双人民政局去上课核实，如果还是对吧？这个民政局这个这个这个不配合或者说做不了那这个业务，我们可能就不做。还有一个第二个环节，在集中作业环节，呢我们是前面呢就是在之前检查检查和检查什么法律法律规定的支持下，我们也在接待做一个在接待业务一个客户作业环节，请客户签署，这个也是对啊我们客户经理的一个相当于到了风险啊这方面的约束，就是说说就是我的客户经理不要不要跟中介有这种唉中间有任何的一个往来，经济相关的。
00:24:42
    然后最后一个代购环节呢是需要多部门在几个方面合规上面的一个管理。从经营单位来讲，呃经营单位对普惠经营的能力呢我们也需要进一步的去提升。一是在用好产品和激活渠道上面，呃需要点点滴滴，包括在提升上面需要点点滴滴去去提升。我们每个经营单位呢还是要有一个清晰的一个方向目标和路径，要有一支能够战斗的队伍。嗯因地首先呢我觉得因地制宜，要运用好产品，结合本地实际，呢我们要不断的丰富产品的运营。总的来讲现在来看也就一个做大技术产品对吧？这个要能做，还有一个特色产品要会做，要会做就不要守一两个产品对吧？去过于依赖。第二个呢在激活渠道上面，我经营单位呢提示一下可能普遍存在的重搭建轻维护的一个情况，缺乏日日常的一个对接回顾，基本上就是这个建筑就我看我看很少，就是可能大家都觉得h二建的这个客户就源源不断会来，这个可能合作的还比较浅层次的。
00:25:46
    啊第三个呢就是按照层层对标，不断提升普惠的产能，重点呢是客户经理的人均产能。啊也可以看一下，就是现在有的现在发现是做的多的客户经理啊这个管控越来越多，还有一部分客户经理呢我看有没有什么动对吧？这个管控还是比较少的，大家通过下面两张表可以看一下，第一个是在那个普惠产品的运用上面，呢我觉得这个产品因为我们也不去跟其他先进方案内容，你看看我们自己方案内容，从这各类的产品来看，可能做得最好的就是大家的一个标杆，啊对吧？我们每个产品有经营单位，每个都有经营单位做的特别好，如果说每个经营单位在各个产品上都能够去发力的话，也也足以支撑，现在应该是能足以支撑这个经营单位呃目前的一个发展的一个要求。下一个表呢是我们呃各个经营单位回归人员的产能，啊大家也可以看一下，就是人均产能呢是参差不齐，常州高呢我们总结可能是源于这个全员营销，而且是以线下业务为主，年层高呢是源于线上业务实现了批量获，客南京地区高，呢也可能更多的原因是专管经营线下宅基地业务。
00:26:56
    所以对于产能呃产能这一块的提升，呢我觉得是几个方这这样的一个策略，也就是还是从产品上来讲，还是更多还是线下标准化业务加上线上业务同步的一个提升，线上业务呢我们也陆续会再上线一些普及性的一个产品，对吧？唉线下标准化呢我们觉得可能在第二人均人均25我觉得应该是可以做到的。因为我们从我们专题来看，现在可能就是在今天也已经达到了55，这个50户的以上的也有5个人，线上业务呢可能是不是我们定一个目标，人均20，专职的可能能达到50，所以因为人少，这个确实是可能大家经常会讲反映的这个问题，确实一个客观情况，那我们通过人均产能的这样一个提升，通过线上线下启发力，我觉得在现阶段或者说未来两年内这个空间还是是不够的。啊大家也可以看一下左边表，包括我们普惠专职的，我们普惠其实专职啊做半年以上的客户经理一块，已经人均反馈已经达到了66，也大概66，应该讲先进工业可能在40~50。所以我们现在我们这个线下标准化加线上业务同步提升，呢这应该是提升管控的一个我觉得一条路径。
00:28:11
    第二个是我觉得从经营单位来讲，呢还是要提升普惠金融的主动营销意识，就下一步下一步就是我们也这里头呢也重点讲一下这个漂利贷这个以省省担保重点是以省担保为例，吧就是去年呢我们票一贷开始担保合作，我们因为我们有先发优势，可能我们唉底下一同业，所以当时是当老师给我退课，对吧？我们都是等课上，啊今年呢其实其他银行也都在合作，并且呢也会反向建设，并且很盯得比我们盯得要紧。所以发现呢今年呢其实我们这个票现在啊省担保这个业务呢增长压力蛮大的，所以我们也希望就是举一反三，啊就是说更多的还是需要主动的营销，主动的作用是吧？我昨天我们去年做的可能成果我们可能有可能是包袱，我们要如果不去做的话，那我票一带678月份到七7个亿左右，如果我们去见客反向推荐客户的话是吧？这个可能压力比较大，因为只有好像见客主动权才在我们手里头。盐城分行呢已梳理了21部这个承兑人反应大，对吧？我觉得这个26百名呢已经有落地的这个推进的，如何呢我就可能决定了盐城对吧？这个业务后续的一个一个一个增长的情况，唉包括在花型和到期管理呢也也需要去进行进一步的一个管理。
00:29:29
    第三个呢就是强化各个层级管理的一些职责。我觉得现在经营单位在管理上面还是存在两个两个缺，一个缺失，一个缺位，吧下一页。一个是过程管理的一个缺失，对过程管理呢重视不够，力度不足，靠月底月底呢称指标，确保数基本的没有确保是吧？各个经营单位月初也在会议上也给我们报了这个确保数，现在发现可能没有基本上没有完成，这个确保大家可以看看就是我们在这个月底投放这个后面列了一个数字，我们原来是可能经营单位3000万任务的时候再抽5000万，再抽两个亿再抽，现在一年七八个亿的时候还是靠这个最后几天再去买，我们最后两天3月份最后两天是投了5.25个亿，6月份是5.58个亿，就出现了最后连你的话题都在调整的，觉得最后出现了还是说这个时代来不及了对吧？这种情况如果放到之前可能是不是会会好一些。第二个呢是分层管理的一个缺位，啊就是我觉得呃分分管各位分管人员比较辛苦，啊我觉得对普惠竞争来讲，呢需要可能需要投入比以前更大的时间，更多的时间，更大的精力，呃管理部门在业务推动过程跟进过程跟踪上面，可能也需要更进一步的一个精细化的一个管理。
00:30:45
    呃我们以常州常州我这个特别想讲的就是常州，我们尤其是我们徐总，啊比如说我这个但是我们在一带一路上，我觉得付出比较多，啊和在在这边有每一步的流程和遇到的问题呢都会牵头来跟我们沟通，就有这样的一个业务管理部要牵头人，然后呢可能我们会跟授信审批部一起去这样一个问题一个问题的去解决，这个减值带流程会比较顺了。现在可能还要经常反反映说我这个在这个在业务啊可能还是疙疙瘩瘩的，我们也感觉到这个这个不顺那个不顺，所以我们也是欢迎的经营单位来给我们一个堵点一个堵点的去解决这个问题，大家不要怕反应问题。第三个呢就是第三个方面呢是完善区域经营机制的建设，一方面是加快专业化的经营，总行呢在6月19号呢就是开了一个对普惠这个对公客户进行分类这个建设的会议，专题建设会，各位领导参加了，这是总行包括总行的董事长和行长参加了这样的，就是从总的来讲，这是启动全面启动这样普惠队伍一个专业化建设的一个进程。从分行这个呃普惠队伍建设的一个呃计划来看，呢就是今年的平台，你现在呢是18个人，包括内部转岗外面已经10个人，包括新入党大学生团领导也支持就定下来，这个定会先开始是吧？所以一刚才讲100亿的规模，啊如果没有这个扶贫专职队伍，我觉得后续可能难度会更大。
00:32:15
    你从我去盐城加气站的一个案例，啊就是我们在其实盐城在接待之前觉得觉得做得也挺难的，对吧？就是咱现在这个业务大户进入也小，对吧？可能一个月也挣不了多少，但是专职队伍配了两个人过户，现在一个人到位，上个月挣了1000万，对吧？储备这个月初已经储备了1000多万就年，前我觉得年前这个通过专职这个宅基带能做得起来，就是其他部门其他经营单位更应该没有问题。对吧？从整个客户经理来讲，就是所有的客户经理来看，人均25以上的保护，25以上的已经有30人，10~25是24，所以没有专业队伍去后面去承担一些这样的一个工作的话，全靠这个公司客户经理来做，压力的增长空间也越来越大，嗯增长压力也会越来越大，用不了的是我们现在可以配置对我们的这个情况，也请各个经营单位给予支持，尽快配配备到位。啊按照这个年初提的要求，在普惠队伍建设来讲，呢嗯我觉得主要是三个方面在下一页，第一个呢首先是这个队伍是要建的，这个是大家毋庸置疑的。
00:33:20
    呃对分但是呢这个件我们可能就分行呃大家也不要走向另外一个观点就是认为这个后面我这个普惠发展全靠普惠战略，对对于上海银行来讲，呢这个可能我们还是要专接经营专接结合去做好普惠的一个发展，对吧？不搞一刀切，不搞一步到位，啊我们队伍呢也分为三类，这个无限做了一个方案，做了一个队伍呃普惠队伍的一个考核的一个方案这个里头也提到了一些思路，这个包括把队伍进行进一步的进行细分，这个我觉得也是可以大家可以参考一下。第二个就是在网上面，就是在我们普惠队伍这个专职队伍去建了过后呢并不只是去做贷款对吧？总行的定位也是还要做客户经营对吧？就管库是有贷库和非贷款，所以经营单位呢也可以对这个5个专职客户经理的一些现有的这个非不在客户经理管控名下的一些小微结算客户呢分配到客户经理宁夏去做一个综合化的一个经营。第三个就在绩绩效考核方式的方方面，呢也可以呢可以结合就是包括我们现有的基本工呃就买单制和二级分行的做一些差异化的一些考核。
00:34:29
    最后一个就是客户经理队伍的培养方面，对工作人员培养的职责，呢我在分行那经营单位呢从尤其二级分行呢现现有的这个队伍人到位过后，啊还是希望有这个这个要明确这个管理职责，现阶段的考虑由业务管理部直接的去管理推动，无负责人是否可以由业务管理部负责人直接接任去推动这个事情，因为发现没人没有负责人去推动这个服务的发展，因为他们个人可能这个管理呢是有所缺位的。希望通过这个总行呢也在目前呢也启动了一个系统化，今年就是从所有的产品啊这个业务流程啊各方面启动了一个系统化的一个培训，唉也也后面也大家可能就是也会通知大家去参加，希望我们再结合分行的一些专项培训，希望年内能够形成一个战斗力。下一个方面是推动综合化的一个经营，大家可以看一下做普惠呢我只是做贷款对吧？全面推动普惠的授信负债支付结算和公司联动的综合金融服务，我们做了一个统计，这个是对对公普惠贷款的一些东西。那么这里头可以看到在传统方面呢对公平均平均留存率应该是12，存款呃实际也是达到了24，但是呢对公有效户的占比是偏低的，我们也分析客观为可能这里头呢普惠这个有效户占比呢可能偏低，一个很重要的原因是我们线上业务，包括票利贷和房价管理这还不少300多。嗯这个可能就是提款过后啊可能就直接给给这个就对外支付掉了，我们这里面提个提个一个思路，啊就是票一类的线上业务呢当天提款到不会进账户的，大家之前也可以第二天去提现到您的账户。
00:36:12
    这个一天的程呢啊对我们的有效果啊有效果可能也是一个帮助。第二个呢从个人宅基带我们做一个分析，就下一步以个人来看就是不会这个这个比较体现的比较明显，对吧？就是就更多的可能就是放贷款了，就是对这个我们的日均存款，啊包括这个零售的一些产品的运用，呢而这个数字还是比较小的。所以我觉得呢这个我们也跟零售部跟陆总也做了一个深入的沟通，啊我觉得可能两方面，一个是思想上对公客户经理思想上的重视，做不做影响不大，第二个呢营销上呢是还是为联动，可能我们也讨论是不是专业的人做专业的事，更多的有零售条件的人员来营销这个营销的一个产品。切实来看这个可能就一个还是需要两个条件联动才能做好这个事情。我们也对这个公司领导提供一个思路，一个还是呃一体化这个经营，呢还是要双向获客双向融合。
00:37:09
    在下一页嗯提了一个公司联动的总体思路，觉得这个第一个首先重视成重视这个层次啊还是要进一步提高，包括我们可能后续会上来两条线，以产品这个渗透率作为对普惠的一个配置的一个一个差异化的一个考核，包括可能会安排这个零售条线的一个联系人并联联系人做好这个台账登记，一户一登记一户一营销，对吧？对产品化的一个产品做好一个双向呃双向考核，包括条线的联动机制，啊这个大家也可以参考一下，这个这个我们后续两个条件再进一步的细化。下一页是流程上的就是做了一个流程的一个梳理，还是需要流程上衔接好，并两个条件分工明确，营销对象也不局限于这个借款借款主体借款人，那包括配偶股东子女和朋友，我觉得这个都是可以纳入这个这个综合化经营的一个目标的。最后一个呢是最后一个方面是进一步完善呃下半年考核约束的一个机制的一个建设。
00:38:12
    第一个是动态调整机制，第二个是差异化配置，开发配置，我们根据产品的满意程度进行阶梯式的一个建配，这个下面有对吧？根据产品的难易程度那肯定市场资源配置或者资源配置是不一样的。第三个呢是增加FTP的补贴，对于年末完成普惠金融贷款余额竞争目标的经营单位，下半年竞争的这个规范竞争手段再给予15个bp的1个利润补贴，这个就是进一步的加大补贴的力度。啊最后一个呢还是要强化考核约束，对关键时间节点未完成的指标，呢我们的领导班子这个还是会有绩效的，以后吧可以负增长，要加重这个可能要加重的一个唉处罚。嗯最后呢想说的就是感谢就是呃各个部门啊和各经营单位的支持，对各经营单位呢下半年可能我们会盯得更紧，啊是这个不会占比考核这种示范同样的大局，呢也请大家理解和支持。啊希望在大家一致的共同的努力下，让它普惠金融下半年实现能够实现100亿的这样的一个高目标，啊谢谢大家。
00:39:23
    啊总行对南京分行啊今年的目标啊圭业务的发展啊今年是要100亿，110就是意味着我们今年要新增45，啊我们认为啊如果说要想实现普惠的可持续发展，啊我们可能叫综合化、专业化和多元化的这种思路，我觉得永远可能不能动了。
00:39:55
    啊这种背景之下，我们想我们全行我也提出来，我们一个项目型的推进，啊比如说我们去年的票机贷，这种类似的一种一种项目性的，包括今年现在都在正常态，啊可能还有一些医药医药产业地产的就这些产品，包括零碎的啊一年如果没有10个亿的新增，要想达到总行这种高质量可持续发展的要求，很难。
00:40:27
    所以我也提出来我们每一家二级分行原则上啊都必须要有1~21~2个亿的一个项目的实实在在的合作，啊我觉得这是一个啊最实现可持续增长一个必不可少的路径。第二个呢我们还是要后期那种过去走捷径的思维，啊前面也讲了，过去一年下两三个亿的普惠任务，对一家行来说，应付我也能应付过去，啊月底最后冲一冲我也能冲过去。
00:41:06
    走捷径的思维到目前为止已经走不下去了，啊我们必须还是要真抓实干，所以我们在这个方面需要有人有机制，同时我们要有配套的一些考核。啊现在我们全行2000户的到今年年底，个人在个人的普惠客户加上公司的回扣，一起要破2500，2500如果我们没有一支专业的队伍来做，真的做不下去。
00:41:42
    啊所以我们每家行也在思考这个问题。当然尤其对我们南京方案来说，我觉得明年开始总行对南京行普惠业务的增长可能不会低于50亿，啊以后可能就是常态化，是不是50亿能够达到总行的要求，我也不能保证。啊但是我们50亿的增长，我们的战略能不能提升？因为我们南方啊同时还要面临什么？呢我们任何时候我们都不要动摇我们大中型贷款投放的这种基础性地位，尤其我们的政府的啊不管怎么说，我们现在强调我觉得是两个坚定不扰，一个坚坚定不移，啊一个是我们对全行来说，有效的资产投放，啊特别是我们一些有效的基础设施项目的投放，在现阶段这是我们的基础。
00:42:46
    啊如果有这个基础之上，那我们要提高我们的占比，我们就需要付出比个人更高的努力。啊第二个我们叫四大金融战略提升的决心是不容动摇的。啊应该我们四大金融呢现在最核心的啊总行对我们考核的重点也是占比提升，但是从上半年的情况看，除了普惠的占比提升啊比较理想以外，其他的占比提升都不尽如人意。
00:43:21
    我们的科创金融目前在全行是倒数第一，啊我们中长期制造业占比啊艺人比较落后，啊所以这个方面我也真的希望大家啊这种加快发展与调结构转型，怎么统筹兼顾？好，那接下来我们请二级分行跟我们的城区支行发言。啊首先请常州分行。各位领导同事下午好。
00:43:57
    嗯我呢代表常州分行把这个就是嗯福贵金融的一个情况啊做一个专题汇报，根据这个分行的要求，呢我从4个方面来做1个如下，如下汇报吧这一方面呢就是上半年普惠业务的一个完成情况。截止2022年6月，常州分行普惠贷款余额是14.59亿，较年初净增3.88亿，完成分行KPI的55%户，数是398户，较年初净增60户。宅接待银增单线上工业三项重点产品竞争在普惠竞争余额占比中是占比46%。普惠贷款在全口径贷款不含贴现呃的占比是7.06，比年初提高1.83个百分点。从业务结构来看，首先从客户结构，国资企业贷款余额是6.08个亿，占比是占到普惠余额的41.7%，非国资企业贷款余额是8.51个亿，占比是58.3%。呃从产品储备业务的产品结构来看一下，呢就是我行的一个便捷的余额是3.59个，是占比24.59%，宅急待于24.7月23,32%，银政担是8900万，占百分6.06%，线上供应链余额是9100万，占比是6.2%，助业贷于13.29日，占比是22.57%，这风险业务是7800万，占比是5.31%。
00:45:33
    第二块呢就是看一下上半年我们普惠业务的一个定价情况，常州分行的贷款加权平均价14.16，从以下两个维度进行比较。首先是从产品来看一下，呢我们的电解氮是33.91，在接待是4.27，银证单是4.2，线上供应链是4.34，铸液氮是4.32，低风险是3.73。与同业相比较，江苏银行常州分行普惠贷款平均定价在4.2~4.3%之间，房抵贷的类型呢一般不超过就是4%，南京银行的常州分行普惠贷款平均地价是4~4.05%，房抵贷的价格一般是3.7%~3.85%以上的，这样的不含线上的一个存就是信用类产品，我们就是这一带普惠业务的一个综合收益情况，本次呢就是我主要是选取宅接待进行一下统计，开户情况，呢截至6月末，在接待的经营主体开户对公账户是86户，带动存款是667万。公司联动情况，截至6月末，咱现在个人客户存款余额是908万，理财余额是466六万，基金余额是190万。
00:46:55
    嗯这个呢就是大大体就是上半年普惠业务的一个呃发展情况和定价情况嗯存在的问题。首先呢国资占比偏高，结构有待优化，分行储备贷款国资占比达到41.7%，交易季度末下降近三个百分点，但是与年初相比仍然上升了3.5个百分点，正当与线上供应链占比不足10%。第二，呢产品的覆盖组织普惠客户的产品覆盖度较低，带动的存款理财、资金代发等业务的有限。以宅接待为例，截止6月末宅接待客户对公开户数仅占比41.5%，存贷比的近5.3%。第三大块呢就是讲普惠业务的工作，今年的工作目标首先呢是明确呃今年的1个普惠余额竞争不低于7个亿，其中宅接待竞争是1.81.8个亿左右，证明单竞争1.21.2个亿左右，担保公司的担保业务呢是净增两个亿，线上供应链净增1.51.8个亿，普惠客户的户数竞争不低于100户，线上客户数呢不低于30户，普惠贷款占比呢是提升1.5个百分点。
00:48:16
    第二块呢将提升普惠综合的收益。首先是加强公司联动，提升普惠客户在个人存款理财基金等产品的覆盖度，安排的专人做好数据统计与分析，为分层定价等提供决策机制。第三个是保障普惠的资产质量，持续做好普惠贷款的前中后关键环节的管理，保障贷款增速的同时，力争保持贷款的一个零不良。第四呢就是主要重点讲一下普惠工作的一些金融工作的一个举措，吧为了实现上述目标，分行呢将通过完善渠道建设，强化产品推进，提升精细化管理，确保普惠业务的可持续。举措如下，首先呢就是深度挖掘增量客户，分行的本外地客户的约1300户，授信客户的占比呢只有35%，中央的一家存量客户在此全面梳理出有效户，针对无债务分配到人，要求责任人定期保持联系，这一时间抓住业务机会，对于授信客户的加大走访频率，深入了解企业情况，向上上游纵深拓展，通过优质服务获得转借的机会，在转贷过程中优化方案设置，向单一的有待向供应链转化，突破地域，现获取更多的5位客户。
00:49:37
    分行在接待新增客户呢是目前分行的宅接待新增客户是超过30%以上，是通过转接转接转过去，首笔这个票一贷呢也是由普通流贷到多产品的一个价值来获得这样一个票一贷业务真实的票一贷业务啊。第二是加强与担保机构的一个合作，重视担保机构在普惠业务中发挥的作用，除了传统的一个营除了传统业务业务外，通过银证单、分离式、保函票一代等产品加深合作。目前分行在银政单分离式保函是开展合作票据大局核心企业的一个准入，已落级嬴政单是4000万，分离式保函余额超超过了5000万，带动公司业务增收是60万，票一般目前票一般的是准入一户，金额是一个是两户，呢就是以资金观点跟我主要投资正在对接中。第三块呢是积极对接政府职能部门，安排专门每周至少一次对接金融局招商局园区，了解区域内企业的情况，获取优质企业的名单。分行的与4级信保基金合作的产品有外贸贷、创新贷、成长贷与各行政区域开展了园区保合作，基本实现区域的全覆盖。分行将优先选先进制造业、绿色金融、科创企业为拓展目标，作为基础客户进行培育，目前呢已经储备了10 10个客户，金额是8000万。第四呢是聚焦本质优质核心企业，结合省市的重点项目，常州市的532行动计划，自转速改等实施方案，聚焦农业行业龙头专精致新双百企业灵活应用线上供应链，一带拓展优质核心上下游，实现批量获，客分行就是落地天河光能肿瘤医院，民控电子供应链业务普惠发放量超过两个亿，代购普惠余额9100万，目前已与中天钢铁、明天化学、维尔利、贝特累，城东建设就是已经达达成了线上供应链的合作意向。
00:51:43
    第五是探索专业市场合作模式，重视客户较为集中的小商品市场建材、农贸，通过集中走访调研商务的需求，制定合适的金融服务方案，目前已走访了夏季花木市场、凌家塘农贸市场、长青、常州机械、机电城，后后面呢将以点带面逐步展开，营销主要通过宅基站产品的介入，后续的还将进一步研究专业性上的特点，制定专项综合服务方案，形成批量的获客。第六是建立外部机构的合作机制，加强与政府投资机构、券商私募股权等投资机构的一个有效合作，建立长效联系机制，通过研发贷专信贷创新贷等特色产品，尽早参与科创型企业的各项融资活动，分行目前与华泰证券、长创投、五金高新投资控股、百姓投资本金保持定期的对接，依托外部机构的优势助力客户拓展。这其实深化业务联动机制，一方面呢通过梳理优质零售客户，挖掘个人客户背后的企业，寻找公司业务介入机会，另一方面鼓励零售客户经理营销来接待等标准化产品，为零售顾客提供练习。分行还鼓励全员营销员工推荐公司部进行客户初审，对符合基本准入要求的客户分配至市场部开展尽调制定分配机制，激发员工营销的积极性。
00:53:12
    近两年来通过联动落地阶段是超过了30户，金额超过6000万，客户的质量也相对比较好。第八呢就是种植种是广告媒体的一些投入，吧目前呢就是我们常州分行在常州广播。电视楼宇广告中午晚上。到对重点产品来接待进行了推广，分行将来接待电票，保证重点产品上挂常州公共资源交易中心网站进行宣传，指定专门对接，第一时间响应客户的需求。第九呢会加快目前就是在手的银信置业业务的落地，目目前呢分行呢正在和小企业部呢共同推进云10列产品，目前该项目呢正在总行部门会审，后期呢将紧盯流程，加快推进一些就是普惠业务的工作一个建议。最近呢就是当地吧常州当地的普惠贷款竞争是进入了一个白热化，各家银行在准入门槛、价格抵押率等条件上给予放宽的政策，更对审批时效进行大局优化，业务的机会呢也是稍纵即逝，如当地的江南银行、江苏工商银行对房等其他的相关一部分银行对于房地产业务三个工作日结合落地，对于一些就是呃赢单赢单产品，他们是5个工作的事全部落地到位，希望呢就是也希望尚强在普惠业务的审批机制和流程上进一步优化，提高业务的一个落地效率。
00:54:42
    第二呢是优化储备的一个代购管理，希望尽快恢复在接待系统的促后触发式代购，根据目前代购管理要求，需要按月检查新发放与存量贷款，收集征信报告、外部查询信息、抵押物状态这个材料均必须要人工审核，分行的主位客户是超过了200户，平均每户每季度需要做一次代扣，大大增加了客户精准的工作量，希望能够优化相关的这个代扣操作。杭州分行呢将紧紧围绕上级行的工作要求，怀着使命必达的精神，以多渠道加多产品，线上加线下为抓手，以规模增长占比提高收益提升为导向，实现服务业务可持续增长，培育一批与分行共发展的基础客户，谢谢各位。啊接下来几年中呢培训啊李行长，各位领导，各位同事，我把南通分行上半年这个普惠金融的呃相关的一些工作做一个汇报。那么到上半年南通分行呢普惠金融贷款的余额呢是10.99个亿，比年初呢竞争了2.35个亿，嗯增额呢完成率是32.64%，那么其中在一个呢是1.13亿，比年初呢净增了3600万，那这个完成呢是20.3%。
00:56:07
    那么普惠金融的客户数呢是209户，比年初净增了25户，完成呢呃只有19.2%。那么在新增上与这个4家二级分行比，无论在这个客户数还是业务的增量上，都处于一个落后的地位，整体的完成情况呢十分的理想。那么我第二个呢我汇报一下这个上半年呢在副会长也做了一些工作，那么第一个呢是在渠道的建设方面，每一个呢是大力的推进了这个供应链金融业务，我们营销了一批这个投顾特别值得的建筑业企业，同时呢向这个实体制造业客户呢这个推广的供应链金融。那么第二个是这个持续加大与这个担保公司的合作力度，上半年呢我们在用心率上提升了8个百分点。那么第三个呢是落地了民营企业的这个挑一带，这也是一个突破，因为南通呢现在呢在这个跳跃的这一块，呢这个发展的较缓慢，那么因为这是政府的一些控制，啊我们呃在这个上面呢还要有下半年呢还有所突破。
00:57:16
    那么第4个呢是发现了这个平台，那么就是这个我们的工作带，还有园区保。那么第5个呢是组建了这个普惠金融的专营团队，那么这个当前呢还是呃这个团队呢以主营这个宅基带业务为主，逐步呢向普惠金融其他的业务呢进行拓展。那么在第二个在公司联动方面，我们在做普惠的同时，呢普惠的同时，我们也要求在新开户的同时呢要求签订这个代发协议，我们还积极营销这个企业员工的一个代发业务，同时呢也要求这个公司的高管，那么个人财富啊以及这个信用卡业务，那么针对这个个人宅基地的客户，呢我们还这个积极营销这个企业在我们这儿开这个个体工商户啊开这个这个结算账户，提高客户的粘性。从总体来看，呢因为整体的业务量的这个还不是特别够，所以在这一块呢嗯这个还没有特别的体现它的一个价值所在。
00:58:21
    第三个呢在综合综合收益方面，呢目前呢南通的这个统一市场的竞争力也比较激烈，我们分行的普惠金融业务整体的收益呢是从现在来看是有所下降，从贷款利率上这个年就比年初下降了15个bp目前的这个平均利率呢是4.33%。那么通过从统一的这个了解的情况，呢整个南通现在国有行的这个普惠贷款的利率这个目前基本在这个4%以内，那么甚至于有了这个制造业的普惠的利润已经低于这个LP21年期的LP2，那么股份制银行呢目前呢已经接近了4%,4%，我行的这个普惠贷款的利率在同一中来处于一个中上游水平，我们这个也跟南通本地的这个部分这个统一啊做了一些比较，我们在这个价格上、人员上、业务量上，这个也也也大家做了一个现在有个小看法。
00:59:28
    那么从这张表上来看，呢这个5家这个这个从这张表可以看出这个5家的这个我们在这个里面啊这个价格上目前呢不上这个优势。那么在人员执这个机构方面，呢我们是也是远远落后的元户的。但从业务量来看，因为这张表的那个业务量除了这个平安，还有这个苏州，因为这个里面呢我们现在只只了解到了它是一个公司，不会实际上它还有一些个人经营贷不在里面。从这个数字来看，我们呃应该在这个上面呢还是相对比较落后的啊相对比较落后。
01:00:09
    那么第二个第二个方面呢是当前这个经营中存在的一个问题，一个是从6月份来看，我们的工作这个重心啊应该说在半年末的时候导致了整个业务的发展不理想。那么从这个一季度应该说南通分行在经营上呢呃出现了这个巨大的压力，所以呢在这个一季度后面呢我们想在这个条件的工作重心啊像这个分配啊不均衡，那么导致了这个普惠业务的发展，不快乐。
01:00:52
    第二个呢是存量有所下降，啊新增法律这个呢有一定的客观原因，这个是我们在一季度呢我们总共加了9000万的投会，那么6月份还有3000万的这个供应链这个未及时这个续贷，这个我想这个各家行都会有这种情况。那么在新户的拓展方面，呢去年呢我们四季度储备的供应链金融的业务的主要集中在这个建筑业，那么受到这个房地产市场的影响，进入核心企业在授信审批方面也遇到了较大的压力，那么也导致原这个普惠储备的计划推迟，而且这个额度呢大幅降低，啊新增的局面呢十分被动。那么第三个呢是这个普惠的渠道建设不够，那么一个呢是担保公司深度合作进展不明显，那么原来呢这个想通过担保公司付费的方式呢遇到阻力，这个现在是什么情况呢？整个南通原来的担保公司担保的一些客户，现在各家银行都在抢，现在就是切掉担保公司了，整体的价格因为担保有担保公司在里面，担保公司的这种价格呢相对来说要比一般的要高一些。
01:02:07
    那么现在这个南通的一些银这个统一啊看到这个这一块的业务，呢基本上都把保险公司都提出了，所以说前段时间我们跟保险公司也在交流，他们也很着急，他们今年的业务基本上都在萎缩。那么第二呢是供应链金融，我们呢还是过分依赖于这个建筑业，那么其他行业的这个实体制造业客户的成功率也不高，而且比较缓慢。第三个呢是宅基地业务，宅基地业务啊推进不力，那么目前是基本依靠这个部分客户经理啊这个个人这个点到点的这个营销获客，没有起到一个支撑的一个作用。第4个呢就是下半年的这个存量，呢这个过去的这个金额呢也这个也是有一定的压力，从目前来看呢我们还有呃一点这个1.06个亿，啊这可能无法选择。
01:03:03
    那么第三个呢就是下半年的这个普惠金融的发展优势，那么到这个从今年呢我们的目标呢还是首先要确保南京分行下达的任务啊是7.2个亿，不要力争突破，这是年初我们自己制定的年，见证了要达到这个9.6个亿。那么其中宅基站呢形成一个普惠金融贷款的客户呢要达到130户。那么有这么几个措施，一个呢是在拓宽渠道建设，这个要打开这个批量获客的一个新篇章，当然也是一直在谈第一个呢是进一步提升并且带的一个体量，那么这一块呢还是要继续加深与准入这个担保公司的合作力度，提高这个担保公司的用心率。
01:03:53
    啊我们的目标呢在年底要再提高6.75个百分点。那么这样子算下来，呢我们在这个便捷的这个呢我们下半年会新增再增加1.5个亿，那么主要的是在在保和这个综合还有远信。第二个呢是提高票运的一个获客的一个能力，那么这块呢加深与这个担保公司的呃专利代理业务的合作。目前呢我们只有在海安这个一家上市公司，我们投了我给了3300万，那么下半年呢我们这个目标呢这个起码有这个5000万的一个落地，这个呢主要是我们一个全呃国资下面的一个全资子公司，这个是呃纯纯粹的一个贸易公司，啊这个呢他们有这个跟综合担保，有这块业务合作，我们在这块呢已经在深入的在交交流。
01:04:52
    第三个呢是多行业推动这个线上供应链金融，下半年将重点通过建筑业、这个高端制造业以及这个地方优质国企国资这个产业链的企业呢为这个核心客户为切入点，深耕这个南通地区的实体经济。那么我们也做了测算，我们下半年目前啊也是目前我们这个叫储备的啊下半年目标，呢通过供应链金融实现服务金融业竞争2.5个亿，目前呢已经所谓了8户。为了把第一那么预计落地呢是2.1个亿，那么这个还要看呃上级法院一个呃这个审批的一个额度，那么下一步呢我们还持续加强多行业供应链金融的不能纯粹是在建筑业，我们南通还有一个优势，我们的大型这个装备业啊大型装备这一块呢我们也下了下了力气。
01:05:51
    第4个呢是要打开这个啊正应当当这个合作的一个新突破。那么目前呢我们也在积极对接科技局、财政局，我们也通过这个南通这个科创担保啊提供的这个通过带，呃同时呢还积极与这个南通信保合作的一个园区保业务，我们要打开这个呃银证刚刚合作的一个新模式，目前呢我们现在已经有储备，从我们现在的储备来看，我们下半年预计下半年这一块有新增5000万。那么第五呢要持续构建这个展现的这个破坏渠道，那么这一个宅基站呢对我们来说也是一个痛，到目前为止这个做了这些年到现在的财力一个多亿的这个余额，而且今年的整个的新增也只有3000多万，所以下一步呢我们在这一块呢要加大力力度，尤其是在渠道方面这一块营销要提高营销效率和成功率，那么积极要对接呃一些这个第三方渠道，包括这个大陆金服啊啊这个共同幸福。
01:07:05
    第二呢要提高这个普惠专业团队的产能，呃通过对接这个一些园区，啊包括引起的对接的活动，专业市场的集中的营销对接，第三方协调等方式，寻找呢在接待业务的一个机会。第三个呢加强这个交叉营销能力，啊结合分行的全力转型，做这个实体客户的一个基地，那么我们也是要求街面一推宅基带，啊多条件，小孩很小，啊那么这一块呢我呃上个星期也专门跟因为我们常州分行跟这个徐总他们也打了电话，我们也在学习啊在学习。那么在新货的拓展方面，呢去年呢我们四季度储备的供应链金融业务呢主要集中在这个建筑行业，那么这个我们要尽快的就是学习了这个常州分行的一些好的经验，我们要提高这个营销的一个成功率。
01:08:05
    下半年的这个我们的载体，目前在手的载体呢有有2000万的一个投放，那么后续呢我们要保证今年全力的在你的竞争力要达到一个亿。第二个呢是强化内部的一个考核机制，那么我们将普惠金融的开展以及完成情况呢也纳入到客户经理以及部门负责人的年终考评，也是通过开展客户经理能力提升竞赛等方式，全力提升业务条线的这个人员对服务小微企业的认识和工作的积极性创造性。那么在财务资源的配置方面，呢我们这个也大幅提升了这个普惠金融的贡献占比。
01:08:50
    实施过程考核要明确部门的绩效目标。那么从我们现在的嗯目前来，今年呢也是今年在试行，可能不会作为我们今年的应该是叫叫攻坚克难项目，所以部门的任务完不成的话，只能就是完成了南京分行的并保证我们是绩效是打7折。
01:09:19
    我们在完成了叫什么？这个翻一番的计划当中，我们是打8折，完成了10个亿，那么我们是打9折，达到了这个呃20个亿，我们给予1.1的倍的奖励，1.1倍的奖励，这个我们也已经跟市场部门都已经经过都都通过宣导都已经通过宣导。那么第4个呢当然对于这个呃做得不好的，我们也会有一些处罚的一些政策，啊还有另外一个加大处罚的一些政策，尤其是像嗯负增长也是负增长。
01:10:00
    那么第三个呢是加强一个过程管理，我们分行呢也组建了筹备金融的专项推进小组，建立了这个呃信息畅通，呢我们从通过这个微信群，啊每天呢要汇报部门的推进的这个普惠金融工作情况，那么不限于客户营销的客户落地的数据审批的进度，渠道建设，属于一个困难等等。那么因为普惠金融呢作为分行的这个攻坚克难项目，我们现在每周这个在行办会啊都要进行通报，那么我们是找问题、想措施、啊找路径找路径，那么第4个做一个小总结，那么南通分行呢下半年呢也是一个比较清晰的这个路径储备的新增呢达到了5.5个亿，那么加起来呢跟年上半年加起来，我们应该在嗯6.75个亿6.75个亿，目前已经确保了在手上已经有了这个数据是6.75个亿，那么距离全年的目标呢还有一定的差距，那么我们行长是呢将带头研究后会进行策略，持续加强普惠这个拓展管理，啊拓客管理问题。
01:11:17
    那么除上述的这个专项产品储备外，还要加大其他路径的营销力度，确保完成商业银行7.2个亿任务，力争完成分行制定的9.6个亿的目标。那么最后也有个建议，啊因为我们最近在呃上报这个普惠的项目，尤其是在供应链，方面我们也是最近也也是交流的也比较多，那么南通分行南通这个地区呢建筑业呢依然是一个传统的一个支柱产业，这个年产值那个超万亿，虽然受到这个房地产市场的波动，而且而引起的这个部分建筑企业的风险暴露，但是难度呢依然有不少的这个优质的这个建筑企业，啊我们想呢在这个还是在风险这些优质的企业自身的风险控制也是比较严格的，那么我们好像也会从这个资产的规模、啊产值啊负债率，啊包括这些建筑业跟地产板块的一些占比，啊这个这个就产出了一些站点，还有合作这个地产商的一些清单等情况，多维度的这个审慎的寻找这个优质建筑企业的合作的这个供应链金融业务。
01:12:33
    那么我们想呢这个我们今天早上办公会专题也讨论了这项事情，我想可能呃后期呢我也想专门带队呃到南京分行来专门来汇报这一块的业务拓展。那么也希望也不是希望，因为南通分行自身呢也是有信心有能力能够设计好管控好这个建筑类的这种信用风险，我们也希望得到上级行的一个充分的一个支持。好，谢谢大家。啊接下来请分行营业部在会议上表示我代表中央银行步伐也会有这种情况给大家汇报一下。
01:13:17
    那么今年以来也不坚定围绕着夯实产品对客户发展基础，提升普惠性的发展内生动力这一工作主线，重点培养为专职人员，加强部门全员营销，提升维修的业务贡献度，助力公司业务的发展。那么年初部门总经理室呢就制定了部门的客群经营管理计划，其中普惠金融业务要求重点以渠道建设为主，产品选择以宅基带担保公司担保供应链金融为主，除以专程为客户经理下达任务以外，为客户经理在年初就已经下达了全年的非金融经营目标。同时要求普惠金融客户经理，要求普惠金融客户来实现的。公司联动包括不仅限于代发、这个白金卡、信用卡、基金、保险的零售产品销售，部门强调重点分析营销路径，有效把控营销实效，坚定做实有渠道办法，项目推进以及客户主打的规定工作。
01:14:15
    到2022年6月末，部门普惠金融余额3.9亿元，户数158户，余额较年初增长1.45亿，完成序时进度126%，完成年度计划的63%，户数较年初净增43户，完成年度计划的78.2%。其中宅基在余额净增是0.89亿元，户数净增32户，完成年度计划的59%，基本实现了时间过半。这个计划任务不管。那么在普惠金融发展过程中，啊营业部主要的是思路进步，第一就是在借助武汉以太网共同合作的大陆金属提拔宝产品以及常规意在接待产品，着力拓展拓展优质合作渠道，在标准化产品基础上把控客户的信用风险，业务为风险及客户经理的道德风险，常态化推进业务发展。
01:15:08
    呃该项业务上半年呢实现公司联动，主要包括像保险销售、啊信用卡发卡。目前我们接洽的这个财经代表合作渠道基本上保持在40个有效渠道左右。第二就是资产待遇，那么今年年初借助省财政厅和中证平台，对省内政府采购供应商提供便捷融资服务，那么目前项目呢也在传递过程中，争取实现人类系统对接，业务业务落地，后续重点主要为业务的营销推广，实现现代化批量获客。对于我行网点覆盖区域的供应商进行线下营销，推动发展包括代发工资、日常结算零售等业务。第三，园区保业务接触，省担保集团下属公司拓展是个园区的白名单优质客户，目前已完成已在保全而允许保的协议签署，正在对接溧水区湖口区园区网相关园区，年内实现业务落地，并最终实现争取实现了批量获客。
01:16:08
    第四商行医院业务，那么我们在去年两户里30企业65户的这个上海应该续贷的过程这个基础上，今年根据省在保集团子公司在保租赁的业务发展情况，对它进行了一个在保护租赁款项1亿元款项保底的授信业务目前已获批，现在在公司进行业务对接落地。呃我们争取是在7月底之前完成所有业务的落地，因为他这个租赁也跟普通制造业可能还有一点区别，所以中间过程复杂一点。我们希望在年内呢能达到5000万的股票投在提升，为业务的同时，呢能够有效地促进中长期制造业贷款的增长。根据业务发展需求，并结合客户的实际需要，后续加加大开发产品的使用额度投放力度。呃第五呢就是科技型中小企业生产制造型企业，这近一年呢我们也破产了，一批这种类型的企业，预计在年底的时候至少还可以在新增2000万3000万元左右的这个规定贷款发放。但是这个这项业务由于我们人员数量以及人员能力的限制和这块上面不能也不能作为我们普惠企业作为一个有力的补助，可能并不能作为我们后续发展的一个重点。
01:17:26
    那么业务服务业务发展仍然存在很多不足，在下一阶段我们可能从几个方面来做，一个是部门业务发展不够全面，上半年普惠业务呢主要是围绕财经的常规贷款第三行一列，包括像漂移贷的业务呢人为短板没有突破，而且今天可能有所下降。重点产品应用欠缺，原取保的协议虽然已经签署，但是下一阶段我们必须加快园区的对接，实现业务落地常态化的发展。第二是公司联动没有真正落到实处，上半年服务业务带动零售业务的发展见效甚微，其中仅仅信用卡呢只发了300发了12张，啊因为今年可能多数的卡申请申请比较多，对大量的悲剧，那么代发工资呢实现67户保险销售的35万元。整体来看小微企业企业主日常结算，代发信用卡等方面将作为今后公司联动营销的重点，同时对于提前还款的客户，资金呢可以通过短期产品来进行一些适配。
01:18:25
    第三，业务稳定性发展仍需加强。当下呢整个普惠业务同行竞争比较激烈，尤其是我们宅基贷房抵贷等业务流动性较大，维持存量，保证增量，继续通过呃业务多做业务企业产品多元化来实现，单纯仅依靠宅基带常规贷款无法满足。那么这个政策在园区保票业的现代化业务，也将是我们后续有效发展的一个重点。第四，学员交易使用来加强，目前营业部全体客户经理普惠业务发展水平良莠不齐，总体上仍有待加强，总经理室制定的经营管理计划仍需落实到位，做好过程管理确定，确保每位客户经理的营销路径，真正做到全员普惠。
01:19:11
    那么02年是作为也是作为普惠金融大力发展的一年，也是今后普惠金融也是今后公司业务转型发展的重中之重。业务重点不仅仅在于完成全年计划，更重要的是拓展获客渠道，稳存量保存量，多取利息，实现普惠金融的长远持续发展，谢谢。好，接下来请龙江支行同样是今年上半年，唯一不可能啊李行长，各位领导，各位同事下午好，下面我代表临江支行汇报一下目前的这个工作的情况。一是上半年这个完成情况，截止2022年6月末，龙江支行不会贷款余额1亿1816万元，比年初下降2600 2467万元，完成信息技术为负的27%。
01:20:04
    上半年支行发放宅基带14户3403万元，鞭炮宝、鞭炮、电票宝1902万元票一袋170万元。这个小企业贷款两户520万元，上合一建920万元，付飞婷是600万元，这个合计新增贷款呢是7409万元，但是呢由于宅基贷还款300万元，小企业贷款到期1345万元，上方医院到期7007万元，垫车保还款1224万元，合计下降9876万元。噢这支行这个不会完成成为附属全全校倒数第一。二存在主要问题。上半年普惠业务的这个结果归根结底还是支行对普惠业务的重要性认识不够，对普惠转型认识不深刻，还是想做简单的事容易的事，想一蹴而就，想立竿见影。面对困难，方法不足，办法不多，韧性不够，具体来说以下几点值得这个反思。
01:21:09
    一是路径依赖严重，产品渠道过于单一，普惠业务的指标过分依赖汇通达反向保理，一个企业一种业务，当新年度授信没有批下来的情况，业务下滑严重，且其他业务很难补上缺口。二宅基带业务仍未找到适合支行的发展模式，在现在期限长，业务稳定是诸多普惠业务的基础。目前支行仍然是采取客户经理零散营销的方式，渠道建设尚未打开，缺少与渠道稳定有效的合作，体现出业务散金额少，风险大的责任，较年初增加3323万元，新增户数13户，仅完成全年就是宅基带的这个竞争指标的28%。三件套保业务获客以线下为主，客户单一，稳定性差，业务受市场价格波动影响较大，飘逸贷业务也没有利用好支行传统的这个经营区域开展营销，是综合收益不够，公司联动做得不好，定价水平偏低，贷款发放后和企业谈好的综合金融服务方案落地也比较复杂。
01:22:24
    第三大点，下半年工作下半年的主要工作，根据目前的人员情况，客户情况及经营特点，支行对下半年的组织工作制定了多少对制度的方案。一是加快上行业业务落地，目前支行已获批上行业业务汇通达1.5个亿，金浦园林1000万元，合计1.6亿，剔除已发放的920万元，预计下半年能够发放1.3个亿。前期企业用信期以三个月为主，期限较短，支行要把握好发放的时间和节奏，控制好年末的规模，同时要侧重于贸易背景真实性的审核，确保用心的安全合规。二加强小企业客户拓展和营销，在营销中重点关注制造业科技型企业，原则上至少要具备省市及高新技术企业资质，有一定的成长性，有稳定的现金流和成熟的上下游客户，尽可能与我行准入的担保公司合作，或者使用我行小企业的产品，降低贷款风险。
01:23:32
    目前已取得批复客户两户，1500万元，为江苏盛江载运有限公司1000万元，南京高利信息技术有限公司500万元。上报过程中有两户，金额1400元，为南京港汇光电科技有限公司600万元，秦盾科技有限公司200万元。营销并收集资料的客户有5户，2100万元以上三类客户共计5000万元，如果有50%获得情况，预计可增加贷款2500万元。三、大力推广支付宝和电商网业务，多渠道获客。支行上半年做了1902万元的电票网业务，手续简便，收益良好。下半年支行利用这个贴现客户角度的优势，向有商贸业务的客户推荐我行电饭煲业务，同时与有一定商标客群的企业合作，支行将安排专人负责与企业对接工作，及时与持票客户联系，提供良好的服务，尽量提升客户的体验，下半年争取新增电票管业务余额1000万元。
01:24:44
    四寻找优质宅宅客户，建立稳定的顾客渠道。一是加强学院研究的力度，每个对公客户经理及个贷客户经理必须完成两户宅基带，理财客户经理力争推荐一部宅基站，重点在6m100万元以上的客户中进行梳理。二是支行必须建立一个稳定的在其他的顾客渠道，力争下半年支行至少落地在在业务3000万元。五上市公司的上下游及子公司，智目前客户中有7个上市公司，目前还有suga，在营销过程当中，客户的资质号要求的贷款价格也很低，提款需求破解要难度大，但是我们了解到部分企业的子公司目前还是有一定的贷款需求，之前谈的总体合作方案的时候也有初步沟通，但是后续营销没有跟上。
01:25:38
    下半年重点营销促销科技部、园林等客户的子公司争取有2~3户问题，金额在2000万元左右。综合以上几个方面，通过商行一店可完成1.3亿元，小企业客户可完成2500万元电套管业务，可完成1000万元，在其他业务可完成3000万元，上市公司子公司可完成2000万元，合计可完成2.15元，2.15亿元，在补上上半年2467万元的缺口后，一定能够完成分行下达的全年普惠任务。在业务开展的同时，在期待电票宝业务的操作风险，若担保的科技型企业的信用风险，明年业务的可持续发展，支行和业务发展的模式以及支行普惠队伍建设的方向，也是支行下半年继续关注和思考的问题。目标路径确定后，落实是关键，我坚信在行领导的领导下，在分行部门的指导下，在支行全体员工的努力下，龙江支行一定能够在下半年打好5个业务的完成账，确保年底完成分行下来的全年不会。
01:26:50
    以上是龙江市长的汇报，不当之处请各位领导同事批评指正。你请江明市长。尊敬的李行长，各位领导，各位同事，嗯根据分行关于普惠金融三级会议精神的要求，下面由我代表张志强做发言，材料如下。呃我的发言主要分为两部分，一是上半年经营情况与问题分析，一个是下半年经济发展规划，嗯截止2022年6月，江西政法委会金融贷款户数35，余额1亿1288万元，交警处增加了10户，呃增加了余额增加了736户，呃136万元，全年任务指标完成率只有8%，在全南京分行人民告诉第二，问题分析，一个是主观能动性不足，虽然支行已联系了27个顾客渠道，但客户经理的主动营销较弱，未对于大部分客户渠道建立稳固的合作关系，导致客呃考试极端情况较为不稳定，且存在被他行抢单的现象。
01:27:58
    二是区域生根不足，没有充分利用好家里当地资源贫富，未能建立好符合当地经营特色的顾客渠道，导致区域市场混合情况相较于大盘之差，区域市场份额占有情况较低。三是管理水平有待提高，在渠道建设客户因为绩效考核风险控制等方面与新单位存在一定差距，全员营销意识不足，营销人员的日常行为管理有待进一步提高。四是产品体系的学习与实践有待进一步提高，未能充分利用好优势拳头产品，主动营销客户市场普惠产品利用率较低。嗯第二部分是下半年经济发展规划，上半年家庭支行将紧紧围绕分行战略部署，全面完成分行下达的普惠金融业务指标，实现普惠余额净增1.8亿元，其中科创维护制造业贷款占比不低于10%，实现宅基贷余额净增1.2亿元，实现票贷余额净增0.5亿元，实现供应链金融余额净增幅低于0.3亿元。具体工作主要围绕以下4个方面展开，一是大力发展线上加线下业务，稳步推进普惠金融业务。
01:29:07
    嗯一是加强优质宅基材基带货客渠道的拓展，充分运用我行医宅基带和普通宅基带产品的优势，交换材料的巩固，顾客渠道的营销拓展，先以累计联系顾客渠道27个，建立稳固呃户口渠道5个，目前的接月接单量在1000万元左右，预期强化主动营销，后月接单量月接单量不低于2000万元，权利责任的余额57.2亿元新增。二是依托区域产业优势摸排核心客户，做好现场供应链金融业务，以此实现股东金融客户批量顾客，目前已准备供应链金融客户三户，其中江苏移动办公的项目近期将以下三种模式与信心呃予以新型开展两笔相关业务，在落地后与到最终就相关业务流程进行统一梳理后，在予以批量运作。呃中交南方的也已经超过综合授信，在总行在获得总行批复后，呃中交呢将我方纳入其主动银行体系，后续可追票据贷工业金融业务等方面开展具体的一个合作。
01:30:12
    三是大力营销，拓展效益带客户，与省信保达成业务合作共识，并建立了微信工具和微信工作群。目前已确定的共同营销项目是原委员5000万元，本周三呃这个上面洽谈，同时呢还将继续营销女主持人看看最头疼的项目。第二部分是充分利用区域资源禀赋，重点营销科创服务业客户。现在正围绕江西区域内主要产业布局进行试点用，因为目前主攻方向是智能电网、智能制造和节能环保三大产业。通过布局推荐关系营销和同业推荐的二度释放已实现和平科创股会呃客户一户500万元，近期即可投放，嗯以实现绿色能源类客户千一，基本不知我方并实现代发客户48户，月代发金额55万元。比如说一线上接线客户一共实现接线余额200万元，积累了一定的区域科创不会嗯客户营销的经验，下半年市场将立足家庭科创市场，进一步加大营销力度，推动区域科创普惠客户的营销客户能力，提升我行区域市场占有份额。
01:31:20
    三是积极推动担保单业务大力提升，呃不会获客能力。目前由于省信保呃园区创新部达成战略合作协议，近期将将先预期开展一笔并接待业务，在落在落地后嗯梳理相关业务流程，以此实现对接单业务的绿色通道流程，预计年底前并在业务合作投放不足于2000万元。降低工商担保已实现贷款投放700万元，工程支付款保函500万元，已准备1000万元这个绿色能源类客户贷款项目，后续业务正在年度中，资金担保正在积极洽谈业务合作模式，下面我们将围绕区域内高新园区和中国综合保税区的高新技术企业开展共同营销，力争年底前实现业务合作2000万元。四是加强公司联动，提升普惠客户综合回报能力。一方面加强支行私行客户与代发客户的摸排，认真梳理营销符合我行数据编号的优质服务客户。目前已通过代发业务顾客、优质客商类专业普惠客户近期可实现500万的投放。
01:32:23
    另一方面逐步树立我行存量普惠客户，加强与理财经理的营销互动，重点营销工资代发类，高管财富与财富呃与消费类的业务，一直强化与客户之间的合作联动，提高普惠金融客户的综合回报能力。上半年已转借公司代发普惠客户商户代发工资户102户，月贷款总金额62万元。江西上市成立以来，股份业务的发展一直是我们支行相对比较薄弱的一个板块。2022年我们将将在完成股份业务呃呃股份业务任务指标的前提下，提升支行全员股份金融营销意识，生根区域特色市场，积极建设稳固普惠客户渠道，提升区域普惠金融市场份额。呃供述说完毕。好，最后请吴西爸爸妈妈。
01:33:13
    啊李行长，各位领导，无锡分行汇报一下，首先汇报一下这个不会金融业务的发展情况。2022年上半年在上级行的关心指导下，无锡分行全行目标明确，激励机制到位，组建普惠专业化的队伍，多策并举之下，普惠业务净增3.33亿元，较去年取得一些进步，净增量是去年全年净增了90%，但是呢距离半年度的这个目标还是有一定的距离。同时普惠的户数和宅基带的竞争比较缓慢，下半年还需要重点加以推进。那么江阴支行的古的完成情况，江阴支行上半年惠贷款余额竞争和重点产品的竞争均超额完成了序时进度，且普惠的余额户数和重点产品的竞争在分行的占比均在40%以上，贡献比较大。但是呢宅基带的一个竞争比较缓慢，需进一步加强对宅基带的营销投放。第二个是从产品结构来看，上半年信保基金向下的不会贷，担保公司便捷贷，国内信用证付费型业务投放比较好，较年初涨幅分别是99%、163%和97%。
01:34:33
    宅基贷净增了4100万票，一贷净增了400万，完成率分别是23%和4%，较指标的完成差距比较大。反向保理和一般个人经营性贷款均为负增长，这个新增情况不理想。第三个呢是当地同业会业务的一个情况分析，那么我们也是选取了当地的5家同业来进行一个对比，分别是江苏、南京、北京、苏州和浙商银行。那么从上半年的余额净增情况来看的话，我行业在第三位要好于苏州，呃于北京、苏州和浙商。但是从普惠占比情况来看，就是刚才这个分行出具的数据，那么我行的占比仍然是最低的，那么普惠业务的发展和业务转型还需要进一步的加快和加强。
01:35:25
    第二个是存在的主要问题与不足。第一个是规模偏小，占比较低。我行6月末的工会余额不足10个亿，在4家二级分行当中的规模最小，那么和当地主要的城商行相比，规模和占比均为落后，那么分行将以提升普惠的规模作为重点发展目标来持续的努力。第二是虽然今年各个经营单位和市场部对普惠业务的重视程度有所提高，但是业务基础相对较差，缺乏紧密的合作渠道和稳定的获客来源，批量化的获客上未能形成有效的路径。第三个是对重点产品的应用上不足，那么各市场部仍然习惯于围绕政府平台类的企业开展合作，对于实体普惠客户的抓手不足，拓展力度不够，客户经理在营销实体普惠的时候仍然存在一定的畏难情绪和心理负担。第4个是分行在二季度明确了5+3的普会专职客户经理队伍，制定了全新的普惠业务考核方案，但是专业化队伍的转型还需要进一步的强化和引导，成效有待检验和提升。那么第三部分是下半年的工作目标和措施，下半年分行以通过重点产品驱动、渠道合作拓展、配套机制优化、公司联动为主要的工作主线，全力推进普惠业务发展，确保完成全年目标。
01:36:55
    那么重点的工作措施主要有几个方面，第一个是持续丰富普惠业务的获客渠道，形成较为稳定的朋友圈。第一个是打造宅基道的顾客渠道，批量增加批量的业务来源，明确由公司部牵头推进分行成绩的渠道建设。从上半年开始，公司部逐步建立了大到金福、小菊、小飞、马新、福州等宅基道的户口渠道，下阶段将继续由公司部的普惠专员进行牵头对接，逐步完善营销机制，通过微信群完成接单询价，简单评估等前期的工作。第二是有无锡分行的营业部和江阴支行的专职客户经理对接渠道，定期拜访和重点营销。三是设置宅基带业务的专项费用，通过专款专用营销推动宅基带的渠道建设。第二个是打通中信保的获客渠道，增加股会外汇业务的来源。那么6月20号已与新到任的中信保护西分公司的负责人进行了业务洽谈，明确合作的方向及客户的范围。市场三部也与中信保的各业务部门完成了初步对接，对于中信保合作的300家活跃外外汇客户进行梳理，以此通过批量获客来做大无锡分行的普惠外贸代理业务。
01:38:13
    三是走进各大园区，拓展稳定的合作渠道。分行已经梳理无锡地区15个园区，明确每个市场部生根一个园区，至年底各部至少营销储备园区，新区新户10户，实际拓展落地5~6度。第4个是通过担保公司渠道来增加批量化的顾客来源。到6月末将信联融资担保150,000,000的担保额度已使用6000万，用心率40%。无锡联合融资担保7个亿的担保额度，使用的1亿零五百万，用心了15%。那么下半年分行在继续营销用好与合作担保公司合作的同时，至少新增宜兴地区担保公司一户，通过新增担保渠道来进一步做大做强宜兴地区的便捷贷的业务。同时你加大与省再担保无锡分公司的合作力度，在有在业务园区园区保业务合作的基础上，做大无锡惠山经济开发区的一个园区保业务。第二个是多元化的产品，有效来提升普惠业务的综合收益。一是深入研究我行的供应链平台业务等普惠业务的普惠产品特点和行业特点，通过线上化平台类产品的使用来提高普惠业务效率。
01:39:31
    一是营销已批复项目的尽快用信，目前我行已批复东珠生态7000万，基金分能8000万亿，融金利300万和无锡交建2000万的反向保理额度。二是全力推进储备项目的落地，目前正在营销过程中的远程电缆、中建材、大众互联共赢年，以及江阴支行正在推进的徐工1亿元的中交一，公局5亿的金桥化工以及大金集团的供应链融资项目，后续将进一步对接总分行，商谈可行的上行业的融资方案。通过供应链的批量化，派生普惠新客户形成增长点，今年的目标是新增7000万。第二是全力突破票易贷的业务，以央企二级子公司省市重点国企为重点目标，来加大对于票易贷业务的营销顾客。三是充分了解无锡地区市场普惠的定价水平，在符合市场定价的基础上，无比核定贷款利率，争取我行的效益最大化。第四是通过为客户提供账户结算、代发代扣理财、个人VIP服务，综合金融服务来提升我行的综合收益。第三个是围绕普惠的考核项目，在重点产品占比客户数新增上寻求突破。
01:40:50
    一是加强对市场部的一个考核指引，通过PPI指标的设置，对于普惠及重点产品进行量化考核，分值分值共占到19分，同时对普惠金融的完成情况实行一票否决。第二个是重点推动便捷贷业务，下半年江苏信联融资担保的1.5亿额度，用心率争取提升到75%以上，无锡的联合融资担保七七个亿担保，我们争取使用到两个亿以上。第4个是公司联动做大无锡分行的业务规模。第一是关注案件客户的提前还款情况，针对这类客户通过我行宅基带的产品来进行二次营销获客。第二个是对于普惠客户的法人代表或者个人股东要求在我行开立个人账户，以此增加我行的VIP客户存款、理财信用卡等业务。个人的普惠客户要求在我行开立企业账户，以此来增加账户的结算量代发的业务。目前已完成存量173步的不为客户制定，下半年将重点针对存量的客人载体的客户，以新增企业结算账户30度，针对存量的公司付费客户，以新增个人VIP客户35户，打通公司客户与个人客户的一个界限，来提升中国贡献。
01:42:11
    那么下面呢这个是我们下半年的这个排出来的普惠金融业务的一个储备的一个明细的一个情况。第5个呢是进一步加强专职队伍建设，那么4月份我行完成组建普惠金融专职队伍，到6月末已初见成效，江阴支行和营业部的两名专职普惠客户经理完成普惠竞争2.09亿元，占全行普惠竞争的63%。市场二部的公司篇幅为客户经理普惠竞争5300万，完成续时进度的97%。但是呢一有完成暂不理想的部门，下半年还需要进一步加强专职客户经理的这个引领。第一是加强管理考核，下半年分行将加大对于普惠客户经理的管理和考核力度，通过买单制与公司板块总资源配置挂钩，与评优挂钩等方式，来进一步的提高专职和坚持的普惠客户经理的这个普惠产能。
01:43:14
    二是由公司部推动分行层级的担保公司宅基带的渠道的建设，专职客户经理对接渠道，定期拜访重点营销公司部，严格过程化的管理。最后呢是这个相关的一个工作建议。目前呢无锡铜业线上化的产品比较多，发展迅速，如人才带、科技带、征信带等等，那么为这个本行的普惠业务的总量快速提升也起到了一个关键的作用。那么我们也建议啊就是借鉴他行在江苏地区的一个特色线上产品，以此来助力普惠业务的发展。比如现在这个无锡市的征信公司和宁波银行推出了融易贷的业务，那么它主要是利用无锡市的征信公司，从税务、国家电网、燃气公司、市场监督、法院、科技公积金中心等部门采集的368个信息项来建立信贷审批模型，采用信用方式来对小微企业发放贷款。那么自去年的10月28号上线以来，到今年的6月末，容易贷的授信身体户数已经达到5200户，有1900多户通过了信贷审批，授信总额达到10.7个亿，其中呢有1149户已经提款。
01:44:33
    那么无锡市征信公司也已经开发了这个火眼动态监测服务系统，目前呢也有农行、浦发、江苏、宁波等银行接入了这个系统。然后在此基础之上，呢无锡市征信公司也开发了一个征信贷的产品，啊那么目前呢也有多家银行这个在洽谈这个征信贷，作为普惠贷款的批量获客平台，那么人行也将此项工作作为对各银行的一个年度考核的一个要求之一，所以我们也希望能够后续呢我们也希望能够来借鉴这个方式和产品。最后呢目前我行专职人员到位，绩效考核目标明确，我们有信心有决心在上级行的指导支持下，动脑筋找路径，全力突破，攻坚克难，坚决完成年度的既定目标。啊这个是普惠业务，那么下面呢我汇报一下江阴支行的2022年的一个发展情况。2022年1月16号，江阴支行在南京分行的关心支持下顺利开业，李行长亲自带队参加的开业暨合作签约仪式。开业以来，江阴支行紧紧围绕分行高质量可持续发展的要求，以提高营业收入，提升价值贡献为主线，扎根江阴市场，深化客户经营，细化工作举措，强化精细管理，努力推动江阴支行健康快速发展。
01:46:03
    那么现将半年来的发展情况汇报如下，第一个是对照年度经营目标找差距，啊这张表呢是我们今年对于江阴党的这个主要的一个经营指标。那么在上半年在公司板块17项重点指标当中，那么有12项指标达成了半年度的续时，5项指标未能达到蓄势进度，分别是票据融资交易量、制造业贷款余额竞争、科创贷款余额竞争、外汇业务中收和国际结算量。那么完成相对较好的指标是公司中收人民币对公新开户，人民币有效客户竞争，现金管理平台互助竞争以及绿色贷款余额竞争已达到或接近全年的目标。那么在零售板块的8项指标当中，有2项指标达到了续时进度，是全量客户数和保险销售，其余呢未能达到蓄势，整体进度是偏慢的。第二个是对标同业找差距。
01:47:05
    我们选取了当地5家同业作为对标行，分别是江苏银行、南京银行、浙商银行、北京银行和苏州银行。其中江苏银行和南京银行，那么算我们本地的银行成立时间较早，无论是机构的数量，员工的数量，还是存贷款的规模都是最大的，在当地也是我们的标杆。我们更多的是关注研究他们在当地的发展重点业务政策以及营销动态。浙商银行、北京银行和苏州银行开业时间叫我们越早，其中浙商银行要要早一点，那么目前呢和我们一样都只有一家网点，业务规模也相对接近，其中浙商银行的存款规模目前是超过我们4.8个亿，其中公司存款多1.4个亿，零售存款多3.4个亿。在贷款规模上面我们暂时领先，主要是对公贷款领先，那么零售贷款我们才刚刚起步，但是从存贷比的情况来看，我们是最低的，仅有71%差距比较大，那么这个也是我们努力的方向。第三个是对照签约目标找差距。那么对照开业时，我们与江阴主要政府平台部分重点企业的签约情况，当时签约的意向为172亿，那么目前呢我行的授信总额是87.5个亿，授信的进度是51%，用信的余额是29.6亿，进度是17%。
01:48:35
    整体的授信的进度上课，但是用信率还是偏低。那么有部分呢是我行主动控制运行规模，有的呢是授信人暂时没有用款需求或者暂时无法使用，但是整体呢还需要进一步的来加强营销的推进，提升用信率。第4个呢是上半年主要采取的工作措施主要是几个方面，第一个是抓重点项目和客户，一方面重视与当地政府合作关系，主动上门拜访了常务副市长，财政局和主要机关办的领导，人民银行、银监局以及政府主要平台企业领导，巩固和深化银政合作关系，实现了部分重点项目的突破。江阴城投投放2个亿贷款带来关联企业存款新增4个亿，康生建设投放一个亿，带动存款新增1.2个亿，投放，江阴支行首笔房地产开发贷款2.5个亿，为后续对公存款及按揭业务发展打下一定基础。同时在手储备的项目有一批未用政府类的客户授信18.4个亿，储备代保政府的授信约45亿。
01:49:44
    另一方面加快对当地优质实体企业的营销拓展，根据企业性质、行业地位，上市公司专精特新销售及利润规模等主动摸排梳理目标客户，上半年新增落地实体类的授信客户11户，已批，未放实体企业授信7户15个亿，储备实体企业授信7户，约4名。第二是抓零售顾客，一是公司联动，由支行班子成员带动营销，对接企业高管等中高端的培训，结合客户需求制定综合营销方案。截至6月末，江阴支行am30万以上客户净增39户，代发代扣客户净增238户。二是外拓宣传，上半年江阴支行累计举办各类理财沙龙6次，户外宣传10次，利用电台、电视台、报纸及新媒体发布广告11次，利用小区电梯护栏集中发布广告一次，带动个人大额存单销售3000多万，理财200多万，保险150万。第三是抓队伍建设。一是加快人员的招募，分行通过智联招聘、行内推荐等渠道开展12次面试，引进5人。
01:50:57
    二是加强人员的培训，针对新进员工制定岗前培训，安排通过面授培训跟岗学习，自主学习等方式，组织社招人员进行系统化的学习。另一方面针对导航员严格落实关键岗位轮岗轮调，在实施轮岗过程当中做好新航员的带教，加强业务管理和操作风险的监督控制，切实防范各类差错。截至6月末共安排3人次的轮岗轮调。三是提升能力，要求新行员必须取得上岗证的资质，截至6月末已有4人4名新行员胜利取得上岗证，1名于6月21号的入指的尚未参加上岗证的考试。另一方面加强人才储备工作，鼓励和要求服务专员、大堂经理分批次参加营销类的资质考试，提升业务能力，做好岗位的资质储备，争取打造一支一岗多职，一专多能，一人多这个队伍。第四是抓内部管理，一是江阴支行的班子成员参加无锡分行的双周例会，在例会后专题召开问题驱动会，共同讨论解决实际工作中遇到的问题。第二是江阴支行的行长是成员以及公司零售客户经理每日召开一会，明确发展目标，总结上日工作，部署当日计划，督促业务的进度。
01:52:18
    三是严把授信风险，所有对公授信均由支行负责人或者分管行长尚总实地调查。截止上截止半年多，江阴支行的表内外融资无后市的余额信贷资产质量良好。四是加强检查辅导，开展多轮内部管理宣导，对重要岗位飞行检查三次，让希望员工更好的熟悉掌握我行的规章制度，严格遵章守规，按季进行防火防抢防盗的演练，并做好记录，接受人防现场检查一次，并获得保平。五是筑牢防疫堡垒，在将于5月4号到18日的疫情期间，安排5名重点人员留行入手，保障业务的连续性。第二个是党建存在的主要问题，第一个是市场份额偏小规模还有待进一步的做大。第一个是总体水平不高，存款份额0.48%，贷款份额0.83%。二是与在当地与浙商银行相比，存款份额落后0.09%个百分点。浙商浙商银行是0.573%是尚未能达到无锡分行的一个整体的份额水平，存款少0.03%，贷款少0.4%，市场占比需要进一步的提升。
01:53:35
    第二个是客群基础不扎实，对于大客户的依赖程度还比较高，不管是公司还是零售业务，对于大客户的依赖程度都比较高，尚未形成感染型的客群结构，其中公司日均存款1亿以上的客户存款占比近50%,5000~1个亿的客户存款占比近30%。在零售客户方面am800万以上客户的am占比近5030~800%万，客户利润占比近45%。主要的原因分析，一方面刚开业主要的精力还是花在大客户的营销维护上，另外一方面对于客群的分层管理上不到位，对于终端客户的重视和拓展力度不够，对于基础课程的答辩和产品运用不平衡。第三是攻坚克难，实体化的转型成效尚不明显。江阴地区民营经济发展，这也是江阴市场的特点，虽然前几年有部分大型集团和企业出了风险，但是经过此轮淘汰以后，剩下的实体企业抗风险能力明显增强。那么今年以来，由于疫情经济的原因，实体企业投资的意愿和融资需求有所下降。截至5月末，江阴市整体制造业贷款的余额1292亿元，较年初增长50.73亿，制造业贷款占比约34%，那么相较广阔的交易市场，我行的制造业的市场占比仅为0.4%，发展空间巨大。
01:55:09
    上半年虽然落地新增的实体授信客户是11户，但是呢还有7户以批未头落地进度还是偏慢，导致制造业科创线上工业的余额竞争完成率是落后的，其中既有实体客户需求不足的因素，也有我们营销力度不够的原因。那么这个呢是将市场的这个制造业贷款的占比，那么我们的再看我们的制造业的贷款的占比的数是4.63，但是江阴的全市呢已经达到了34%，这个差距还是比较大的。第4个呢是零售业务发展偏慢，一是对照今年的经营目标，多项指标尚未能达到蓄势进步。二是客户经理的入职进度落后于计划，那么前5个月呢只有一名理财经理，6月下旬入职一名个贷客户经理，也导致个贷业务才刚刚起步，但是呢这个呃效果呃出险从6月中旬开始启动，那么当月完成接单量928万，目前的接单量已经达到1349万。
01:56:14
    三是外拓营销和公司联动不足，目前个人客户总数411户，am3m三三十万以上的客户数是4户，占比13%。网点主动上门的客户比较少，如何有效的外拓客户，提升中高端客户数量，也是我们必须解决的问题。第5个呢是人员能力有待提升，一个是专业能力有待提升，江阴支行刚成立半年，新行员比较多，大部分男主带教培训阶段导致部分员工与所在岗位的要求匹配上有一定的差距。后续我们将继续落实导师带教方案，分行加大培训指导力度，以提升专业能力来更快的适应岗位的需求。二是工作效率有待提升，团队之间处于磨合融合期，个别时段业务集中影响工作实效，后面也将根据整体的业务情况，进一步的来优化岗位的配置，加强业务规划，提升工作效率。第三个是下半年的工作目标及举措，第一个是总体经营目标，一是对标先进同业，提升市场份额，紧盯接近同业对标浙商银行，到年末存款余额争取稳定在28亿，较上半年再增长3.28个亿，力争多高到30亿元，贷款余额突破40亿，较上半年再增长5.5个亿。
01:57:38
    当地市场份额分别达到0.5%和0.9%，进一步提升在当地市场的影响力。第二个是主要经营指标要达成全年计划，尤其是客户存贷款增收和4大金融等指标，争取超额完成任务，提升对于分行的贡献度。三是在人员方面，一方面继续引进人才，形成18人左右的稳定队伍，那么目前呢是啊16个人，其中公司客户经理5人，零售客户经理3人，那么其中有一名呢是兼顾普惠，那么营销人员占比65%以上。另一方面加快现有人员的磨合和团队的融合，加强业务培训和综合化的重要持续提升支行的凝聚力和战斗力。第4个呢是确保安全运营事故。第二个是具体的工作举措，一是在公司业务方面做深政府的客户加做强实体性企业。一是在做深政府的各个方面，虽然目前对于政府类的业务总体成管控态势，但是江阴支行作为一家新开辟的支行，将作为一个新兴的市场，还有广阔的发展空间，因此呢也希望能够得到上级行的大力支持。
01:58:54
    去年以来，江阴在城市更新、旧城改造、工业园区改造、科创园区建设、城市道路等基础设施建设方面投入较大，预计未来三年投资总额超过1000亿，在本地银行当中以工农中介、江苏、南京等大行为首的银行纷纷发力，城市更新、旧城改造以及工业园区的改造，其中建行南京银行通过城市更新贷款，上半年实现存款沉淀数10亿元，渤海银行6月末投放1亿9个亿的城市更新，也有效带动存款增长。那么江阴支行要想实现存贷款规模的快速增长，在政府的业务方面加强合作也是必然趋势。一是对一批费用的政策里的授信加快落地，7月8号已落地，江阴东有首单超短融的4亿元，本月预计盘乡落地首单城市更新项目金额超过亿元，形成3亿以上的存款沉淀。对于其他费用的授信也要加强营销或者调整，运行方向，及时实现投放。二是加快项目储备，目前江阴支行储备约52亿的政府类的贷款，承销及投资授信，我们将力争于三季度全部上报审批。
02:00:12
    三是扩大朋友圈，加快表外及撮合业务营销，目前储备30亿的保障融资计划，9亿欧元的海外债业务利用信托项目也在跟进，中期票据理财直融资等成效类的业务也在加大营销力度，争取年内有项目落地。那么在存存款方面积极营销江阴市的等级，以及临港高新区等财政局以及其他部委办局跟进招标招投标试点，争取财政性存款落地。那么江阴市的财政性存款从2021年起采用招投标的形式，那么今年以来由于经济下行疫情退税等因素叠加，目前尚未举行增量财政性的存款的招投标会议，那么后续呢我行将加强沟通，紧密跟进，同时积极营销仁恒地产的资金监管账户，争取在四季度实现监管资金的一个落地。二是在做强实体型企业方面，一是强化与工信局、发改委、税务、招商、环保等以及各乡镇的合作，丰富实体企业获客渠道。二是加强与江阴同业的合作，在制造业的银行贷款，新客户引荐等方面增加各个渠道。三是加强与中信保合作，通过中信保的一流来拓展江阴地区优质实体客户。
02:01:34
    第4个是加快待批以后代理呃代理以批代投项目落地，加强目标客户的营销储备，尤其是在制造业绿色和科创类的客户方面，加大公关力度，争取在三季度实现有效投放不低于两个亿。针对目前储备的实体目标客户14户，约14.7个亿，一户一策制定营销计划，争取三季度能够对其中的4~5户发起授信流程。不是不是不是？在普惠业务方面，那么截止到6月末，江阴支行的普惠贷款余额是3.42亿，普惠贷款占比10%，较年初增长1.58亿，超额完成了上半年的蓄势进度，但仍存在后续增长乏力，手段单一的问题。下半年将从以下几个方面入手来进一步的做大5个业务的规模。一是平台化的营销目前正在推进，徐工的供应链2亿元的江江西，京巴票一带融资项目，1亿元的中交易供给的供应链的项目，正在洽谈金桥化工大型集团的供应链融资项目，那么争取在三季度上报1~2户平台化普惠业务的融资授信，年内争取至少实现一户的平台落地。
02:02:53
    二是核心产品的营销，江阴支行将利用我行的普惠贷、外贸贷、宅基贷等优势产品，加强对小微实体企业外贸企业的营销，通过优势产品来拓展业务。第三个是加强与江阴信联担保担保机构的合作。第4个是加强与江阴重点乡镇的合作，目前尚未合作的有华市、心桥助、唐民庭、悦城等阶正将争取营销的全覆盖，业务落地。第五是加强与园区的合作，通过产品推介会、客户联谊会等方式来实现园区普惠业务的一个营销。第六是设置专职客户经理，目前江阴支行已配备了一名专普惠专职客户经理，制定了考核方案，来全力营销普惠业务。那么普惠金融的目标客户呃如下，第二个呢是在零售业务方面是做大个贷业务，做深财富管理。第一个是明确目标和发展重点，针对零售PPI指标，制定完成计划及落实举措，有效开展营销工作，建立合理的绩效分配机制，强化公司联动，开展全员营销。
02:04:07
    第二个是目标客户走访有效，主动走出网点，开展主单位、进社区、进菜场少不工作，制定外拓计划，主动上营销。2022年下半年，江阴支行将继续对周边的社区、菜场以及商圈开展外拓及扫街活动，对已经进入的社区和菜场要巩固成效，扩大范围，对未进入的社区单位排号计划有序开展项目活动，计划下半年每周开展一次进社区、菜市场、商场等活动，同时联合开发商、保险公司、券商、基金公司等开展主题商谈活动，计划上是不少于5次，通过外拓客户问一下沙龙目标，拓展基础客群300户，存款理财销售5000万，保险销售100万，那么这个是一个营销的呃目标以及进度。第二个呢是加快按揭业务的发展，6月份通过半个多月的努力，实现了首笔按揭投放以及收件总量突破1000万，但是对照全年的发展目标和要求任重道远。
02:05:18
    那么七八月份呢也是淡化，也是购房的一个淡季，那么我们争取到三季度末实现收件总量突破5000万，落地金额突破4000万。一是继续加强与中介的合作，全力拓展二手房的按揭。目前江阴支行所有的按揭收单均来自于二手房的中介，那么现在呢有接单的有14家，除了国光地产以外，主要还是以本地的小型中介为主，后续呢将营销、盘江营销、湖南新城联等本地连锁中介的合作，继续巩固和深化渠道合作。二是加强与开发商的合作，目前已经准备一个楼盘正在申报1个楼盘储备申报准入楼盘，1个这个营销售的楼盘有5个。那么第4个呢是加强代发业务的拓展，江阴支行上半年实现了238户代发竞争，全年目标完成率43%。下阶段将继续强化公司联动，明确代发目标客户，逐步制定营销计划，紧盯过程管理。目前呢已制定代发计划550户，通过代发业务持续来增强和夯实零售的基础客群。最后是相关的嗯工作建议。第一个呢是加强对当地政府的业务支持，那么江阴地区未来三年的政府投资比较大，当地银行都在加大与政府类客户的合作，尤其是在城市更新、工业园区改造、旧城改造等方面，那么该类项目的期限普遍较长，同业竞争也十分激烈，那么希望呢分行能在业务政策期限、
02:06:57
    价格等方面予以大力支持，那么江阴市政府呢也非常看重各家银行在这方面的一个投入和支持的力度。第二个是对于江阴地区传统制造业的支持，那么江阴地区实体经济发达，但是传统结构呢相对还是较为传统的，如纺织、钢铁、造船等，目前税收上缴排名靠前的集团基本上都集中在这三个产业，那么也是江阴地区各银行制造业融资投放占比较大的三个产业。那么在这一块上呢也希望上强对于江阴支行上报的优质传统的制造业给予支持。第三个呢就是在运营保障方面，江阴支行作为南京分行辖内的第一家县域支行，在开业期间各项工作得到了南京分行各个部门的大力支持，在此呢也表示感谢，那么运营风险公司零售等多多个系统经过调试以后，目前呢也基本正常运行，也为嘉兴支行的顺利运营奠定了良好的基础。那么目前呢就是还有一个小问题，就是这个信贷风险管理系统，那么江阴支行仍然存在着架构设置的问题，那么南京分行的风险部呢也帮我们与总行做了多轮的沟通，那么总行的答复呢是主要是这个系统呢当时也没有考虑到二级分行下设一级一级支行，现阶段呢暂时无法解决，还需要通过系统改造及开发才能够实现。
02:08:28
    那么目前江阴支行发起授信业务，仍然是需要通过原来的江阴市场部来操作，那么这个呢也给我们的就是数据统计以及业务办理带来一定的不便。考虑到后续，那么其他二级分行也将要设立也将要开设支行，为更好的理顺流程，也建议那么总行能够尽快完成该系统的改造和开发。啊以上就是我的汇报，不当之处进行批评指正。啊刚才这个加油支行应该都做了一个非常好无锡办行，啊对这个江阴调查做了一个非常详尽的分析，啊应该充分肯定，啊应该说做了不少工作。应该家用支行是南京分行的第一家信用支行，啊今天为什么要专题啊差不多，今天是半年，啊请无锡分行跟大家做一些介绍，也给我们齐家其他三家二级分行一点启示。
02:09:31
    啊大家看一看，你们认为目前的江阴支行。是不是？达到了我们。嗯每个。每一家二级分行，我们希望设定县级支行的当初的设想。啊总的来说，啊我们认为南京分行发展到今天，在队伍建设跟网点的建设合理的做加法。
02:10:05
    啊我觉得在目前的这个现阶段，也是总行朱建行长一直要求南京分行做一些认真的思考，啊其实包括普惠业务的发展，啊6月30日这个朱行长给我打电话的时候，其实他也得到了就是普惠业务的发展，纯粹靠线上，总是觉得有隐忧，但是靠现象，我们有没有这样的竞争的能力？有没有。
02:10:36
    合理的顾客的能力，一个是我们需要思考的，啊所以说我觉得啊和你的座驾是势在必行的，但是对我们每一个行业来说，更大更难的课题是在10个分行10个支行以后的下一步。啊刚才这个张军的这个张院长的这个介绍，啊我个人认为第一目标，你们可能跟当初的三年规划的目标，与我们苏州同类的县级支行的比较，我个人认为这样的一个目标。
02:11:17
    是不是可行？但我记得去年江阴支行日均存款大概就在21左右。啊今年我们自己给自己定了个22亿的目标，上半年我觉得这种目标是不是部署特性。啊第二个我希望我们的对标，啊我们对标的是折算一下，啊其实我们蒋局长刚开始也准备考虑这个浙商银行已经但是我们要考虑的是什么？浙商银行的信贷的政策是什么？在无锡地区，啊在江阴地区，由于浙商银行采取的贷款的定价模式是价高者得，导致在江阴地区政府平台的项目，这上面有很多的红色。
02:12:09
    啊其实我们这种上海银行，如果说对标浙商银行是不是选择好的一个可以对标，就需要对标我们具有可比性的一个对标的对象。我觉得这个方面可能无锡分行也需要认真的做一些思考。啊因为总行按照总行董事长的想法，还是希望南京分行加强对县支行的出货，啊县域支行的一些合理的管控啊这个这个问题，呢我觉得也需要我们无锡分行一起，可能我们计财部啊把江阴支行的指标可能也要回头再看一看。
02:12:57
    啊第三个刚才你们提到的关于政府类的这个分行的支持，啊我说这个江阴政府我们不支持不可能，但是总的策略是什么？呢总体支持，但是有保有压，啊这个我们这个这样呢就是上一周我们也统一思想，包括我们长春总体的基调给江阴映出来尽在在停。啊然后我们将来保证的是新的城市更新啊基础设施啊一些新的一些项目，啊我们敞开全力支持。
02:13:40
    啊当然包括我们的一些新型业务啊也是全力支持的。啊但是在目前的背景之下，啊我觉得合理的控制啊隐在的这种啊对江阴银行来说，啊现在是实在不行了，所以这个我也跟无锡方案啊可能做一些简单的谈到我们下一步，当然具体的个案我们可以再商量。下面就是请我们你们刚才我们各家分行啊4家3家二级分行做了一些这个建议，啊可能有些建议可能能够今天回答的就回答。
02:14:18
    啊我个人看了一下，长春分行更多的谈的是审批效率，这个南通分行谈谈就是对建筑业审批的差别化。无锡分行提了两个建议，一个是线上产品的创新，比如说容易的事，要容易贷款的一个产品，我们感觉小企业部怎么去回应，啊然后还有一个就是关于江阴支行的系统的支撑，包括信贷系统，啊这个可能是风险部牵头。
02:14:59
    啊我希望我们今天能够回应的，那么就今天回应没有不能回应的，我们改天再作为你会的人。嗯简要回应一下吧刚才那个两家分行提出来的问题。跟我们审批相关的，一个是就是呃能够呢提出来建筑行业的，这个就是因为是总行设定政策里面是这个行业，嘛但是呢从我们审批的角度而言，呢尤其南京分行的那个南通分行，它属地的这么一个产业的特点，我们来我们这个审计部对这个行业的认定呢还是以实质性的信用风险的一个。综合评判来看。
02:15:43
    那么现在确实呢建筑行业面临的可能关联性的东西更多一点。就是在这个大这个房地产大市开发商现在对吧？这个可能还有一个下半年还有一个啊在无关要过这个经济项目可能。确实需要我们坐下来共同。商量这么一个业务要做那怎么做，包括我们的风控点怎么去嗯怎么去布局，所以这一块呢我我我也非常欢迎南通分行刚才提的建议，啊就是我们专题做个讨论，到时候我们可以跟公司调整，我们一起共同去做这个产品。没有。当下我觉得还是能做的，就是关键是方案。这是一个对手册类客户的这么一个95年的时候。
02:16:27
    那么另外呢这个产品设计现状，产品这块，呢我们今天跟小金库的这个合作也非常多，这个我们也是非常迫切的希望能够嗯现场业务这块能够能够有一定的量出来，因为确实手工的审批线下审批这一块，还是说出于能力，这个也也也回应一下咱们刚才提到的这个实际效率问题。我当时看了一下我们上半年分行嗯就是宅基站的审批，啊实际上宅基站我们现在已经是非常标准化，自从总行的意见调出来之后，我们基本上是跟线上的这个标准是大致呃相当的。那么呃上半年我们一共审批了453笔，嗯比去年同期呢多了40笔的样子，那么其中有130笔大概30%是线上产品，线上那个审批。
02:17:13
    其中西藏审批两种，一个是三那么线下呢一共大概30 320亿左右，我们其中呃有大概15%的样子，大概46笔是呃补档经过补档，那从这个比例来看，呢实际上比去年好很多。因为去年呢影响效率一方面是个标准化，啊另外一方面呢就是确实这个退出党的时间是比较长的，啊量也比较大。当时我印象中至少百分之七八十是需要修复的，那么这个在时效上的影响比较大。那么经过一个是我们线下整改的一个审批标准标准化，呢以及大家的这个专人专访，啊我觉得大家都觉得对产品应用啊包括那个上报质量方面都有很大的提升，所以今年呢应该讲这块的嗯不当的这块影响时效的方面的影响因素已经大大减少，我相信后面会对他更好吧。
02:18:07
    那么个别项目可能出现了风险增业的情况，那风险争议呢我一直也是讲就是风险风险的观点，呃标准上面有一些碰到一些就是大家看到我们当即使拿出来讨论，我觉得也都不是问题，那么我们跟小金库这边我们多次讲的，就是对吧？就是一旦有问题我们就是当面沟通，我希望就是风险在一方面的一些这个案子希望当然我们能有一个结论出来，啊所以嗯所以我而且从我上半年的普惠港的这个审批的感受来讲，呢不像去年我们到了月底季末，我觉得审批的范围也比以前大，应该是比较早的就完成了一个就是分行给我们的一个审批任务。
02:18:49
    那么同时今年我们也在呃零售评审的这个力量上面、也给他们增加了一个普惠的评审资格、应该讲我们的审批力量也有了有了一个壮大、所以也我我我还是比较有信心的、就是大家刚才也讲了很多下半年投放计划、嗯希望能够我们做好一个计划安排、配合好嗯嗯做好这个SP的一个支撑吗？丰田不回不回。刚刚无锡分行呢提到了这个呃GMS信贷系统当中的一个就是这个我们算是一个小班、吧因为总行。当时在系统设计的时候。
02:19:30
    没有设置这么多的这个行的层级，所以说呢现在就是说呃系统当中就不存在，就是二级分行下面还能下设支行的这种这一个层级，前期呢也跟风险管就总行的风险管理部也进行了一个沟通，同时呢就是也在想办法看怎样才能就是现有的这个系统模块下，这个怎样去把这个业务流程走通。那么试了一下，呢就是就是目前暂时呢只能是嗯人就留留在无锡分行的这个江阴市场部下面来进行发起。那么这种方式呢是一个暂时的一个一个处理方式，而且随着我们行今后的这个这个县域支行如果后续还要开展的话，确实给这个不管是统计还是业务方面带来的就是不很方便，嘛也不利于提高效率。那么前期跟总行沟通，呢总行就是说如果要设置这个层级的话，它要进行一个系统的改造，那么后续的话我们也会跟总行加大沟通，吧然后希望同行能尽快的来给我们实现这个系统上的。
02:20:49
    总的这个改造难。嘛为什么到现在改装。它可能整个的系统层级就要改，可能就是改了还是蛮麻烦的。他原来是没有。还有一种他假如现在挂在南京名下，还是有机会的。好，想一下。那小企业刚刚无锡提到的这个合作模式，呢其实近期总裁也跟我们正在协商这个事，主要的主要是是什么？呢是总行现在推出了新一版的新一代就是原来的就是税务贷这个就是银税合作的这个产品。
02:21:42
    原来原来我们上一届过，后来现在是在迭代迭代过后，呢然后应该是前二季度，然后总行也给各个分行相关部门的信息技术部下，就是下发了一个0税0税项目的一个呃改造的这样一个项目，我们应该是已经完成了吧在测试。然后通过改造以后，呢就后面我们新上线的信用贷，是一个它并不是一个传统的就是只是银税，就基于税务数据这样一个产品，这个产品会有，但是呢它设置了一个开放式的一个体系，就是后续的这个信用贷是基于税务大数据基础上可以叠可以叠加其他交易数据或者说第三方数据的这样的一个一个一个产品体系，就是我们总总行呢是6月份还是7月7月份，就本月上海地区会签上，然后呢经过反正我们也跟总行争取一下，还是在7月底会跟我们勾兑一下就是这个产品，这里头除了那个咱们讲的就传统的就基于税务数数据的那个模式以外，也会可以叠加就是基于特定就是特定数据的这样的一个呃呃这样的一个产品，所以无锡提出一个需求，呢我们到时候现在可以沟通，就是在月底的时候还进行产品设计，可以考虑跟征信引入这样的一个合作，因为苏州呢因为苏州征信是做的比较在征信公司做的，做的是在江苏做的最早的，也做最最成熟的，啊他们呢其实上次我们讨论的时候，呢他也提出了这样一个需求，所以这个可能是苏州的这个需求点是一样的。
02:23:22
    那这个可以写一下我们的。好，最后请分管行长。啊做工作的。是不是？按照刚才李行长强大普惠金融要实现可持续。持续发展的目标呃风险可控。我想我我想就是简明扼要提出4个方面的这个问题和这个工作要求。
02:23:53
    第一个呢是5个亿，吧真普惠和假普惠的问题。今天是内部开会，这个目前说的后面就是所谓的这个低层级政府客户业务化，这个站点还是比较高的，啊小金库统计，不知道半年度数据多少，前面统计一季度末统计是要全行接近40%，吧啊1/3以上对吧？有个别经营单位将近一半，我想如果说这一类业务过多，那我们来讲这个可持续发展，或者说我们来分析它这个业务的结构，啊未来的这些这个也是大打折扣。
02:24:40
    啊所以我想这个问题还需要请这个我们各个经营单位还要提高认识，哪怕是有担保公司担保的这些所谓的第三级别，政府客户啊嗯也不见得是多做，啊一定要控制，啊所以更多的这个我们业务主管部门和审计部门要把好关，啊现在小金库已经有一套这个管控的方案，那希望就是能够这个持续的推进对吧？能够调整好这里面的结构，这是第一个问题。
02:25:21
    第二个，就是我们的普惠金融啊操作风险的问题，这个新疆普惠业务的风险啊操作风险是比较大的，这个大家在实践当中已经有所体会，和威信，啊包括这个主体的真实性，包括他资料，有没有欺诈行为的这些，因为我们在最近的一些已经出了风险的业务当中，我们去回溯是吧？啊已经发现这些问题，那么也有可能在诉的过程当中我们会败诉。
02:26:04
    你现在你正常还款的也不可能没有这些问题，啊我们就是没有进一步发现而已，对吧？这个是说明也是存在的。就是借款主体合规性，第二个直接用途的合规性，是吧？那么我们做贷后的检查管理，啊至少在我们行或者我在我们可控的范围内，你这个受托支付也好，对吧？你资金使用也好，或者代步检查是这个情况，他一定要是符合我们规定。
02:26:41
    那么在办妥抵押登记方面，啊因为大家尤其是这个在一起在一个啊标准化的房抵贷，大家都觉得这个这个宝啊都压在这个房子上，是吧？哪怕你这个其他有些瑕疵，如果最后这个房子的抵押，房子是阻止的，抵押也是按摩的，啊总体问题还是不大。那现在可能实际操作当中也出现了以为半透明实际上没有办法。
02:27:22
    包括刚才小金库也提到了这个婚姻状况，对吧？这个叫个人担保，就是夫妻双方带的是个人，啊他他就是假离婚，是吧？没有不知道。重庆。所以这里面就是什么，呢就是我就提示大家，我们讲的叫了解你的客户，对吧？你这个在准住审批的时候，一定要了解了解你的客户，了解你的业务。
02:27:52
    第二个还要了解你的员工，啊啊员工的行为管理非常重要。在这些业务一些批量化的业务，就是一般也惊动不到你支行行长，或者是就在里面你的这个作用比较小的这种业务，对吧？你说大的对公业务啊很多都是你支行行长亲自在营销了，在分析吧在做方案的，像普惠业，尤其这种标准化的，基本上客户经理在经手。
02:28:26
    那么这些情况就是你对员工啊要了解，要关注。啊啊这个客户经理是重点岗位，我们前期这个几个相关部门啊了一个微博，纪律检查室是吧？和小金库啊也联合做了一些这个员工行为。我们是做一些这个叫客户业务的告知书是吧？就是它也是一种管控，也是一种提醒。
02:28:57
    啊我想这个操作风险的问题马虎不得，你这个量一旦上去以后，所以风险引发的重大，也比较清楚。第三个呢就是我们普惠业务的信用风险的问题，这个信用风险还是有。到上半年我们现在看了一下数据，我们现在进入10单业务，啊金额大概在4000万到3000多万，出现了这个3千米3600多万。
02:29:46
    对公的普遍35啊个人在一起的气候。另外还有就是逾期欠息的，还有那个请示，我信用风险还是有的。当然不是说我们要这个目标要追求零风险，那普惠业务呢因为一个现在这个整个疫情啊这个影响还在持续是吧？确实有一些行业餐饮、啊这个旅游啊对吧？其实这个包括这个它的相关的一些行业，它会受影响，受直接的影响。
02:30:25
    那么另外呢就是这个叫线上的线上业务，因为他这个资金用途的原因，我们不可能完全掌控，所以它真正的用途，如果他用去投资，用去其他出现问题，那么也会产生信用分析，除了刚才讲的合规问题以外，实际上也是转化为系统分析。这个信用风险是要值得我们警惕。
02:30:59
    那么实际上是呃这个上午我们参加行办总行行办会啊也在分析，说这个零售业务今年的零售业务，上半年零售业务这个风险的这个管控啊预期就好于年初。我们可能觉得年初这个情况会比较糟糕，也没有结果发现半年度这个实施下来情况还可以，什么原因？呢最直接的原因就是线上有大量建设，比如像借备是吧？借备业务据说到7月份就要全部结清，就是这就说明一个什么？就是个客观情况，当然我们当时设计这个业务的时候，我们也是高风险高收益，但是它表现就是高风险对吧？它的这个一些数据啊不良率啊与现实啊这些数据会体现出来。
02:31:52
    就是线上业务的高风险是一个客观情况，它不透明。啊那么线下业务可能相相对你去尽调去把关，那么金额也相对大一些对吧？就是可能关注度也大一些，那么各方面适当的这个控制。所以我刚才讲就是什么意思，整个信用风险的特点，啊有些疫情下，第二个线上就是我们谈谈普惠这些对吧？尽管我们通过一些措施在化解，但是他背后实际上风险是比较大的。
02:32:34
    那么第4个呢就是实际上也是对我们管理部门啊审计部门的一个提出了要求。保险这是我们的审批部门，啊刚才郭总也介绍了，还是做了一些工作的，在机制流程方面在不断的在完善。在这个业务的顺序安排上，啊我们是优先普惠就普惠优先。当时我们就定了个标准，普惠优先，零售优先，是吧？那么而且审批人员现在叫尖岗啊一岗多能吧？监管就是批零售的也要批图也要学会批图绘。
02:33:15
    那么这样就客观上就是让普惠的是这个数量就增加了，啊当然是对公的必须更重要，必须。是吧？就是在普惠忙的时候、对公的也能来批这个零售的一个IP、所以我想这个人员方面是有保障的。当然如果从更高的要求对吧？整个数字化的审批，从这个长远目标来看，这个当然还差距还是有。
02:33:44
    这样又带着总行进一步的做一些系统的提升，啊包括我们整个一个流程跟进。啊我想这一块做一个提示。所以总的我觉得现在呃这个普惠金融啊我看最近总行好像行外汇刚刚也是研究制定了一个办法，啊怎么来落实？这个监管部门提出的敢带院带、能带会带，就是我们围绕这个8个字你们去分析一下，真正要落地啊或者要做的好，啊这8个字也不容易。
02:34:19
    啊我们现现在自己审视一下自己，敢贷愿带，能带会带对吧？到底做到什么程度，恐怕很多方面差距还是很大。好，借这个会议呢也有一个体外的事情啊也稍微讲一下。就刚才常委也提到了政府融资平台，我们在上周对经营数据的统计方面，包括对引债，啊尤其是引债的这方面，还是发现了一些问题。那么这个呢也是我觉得也是事关重大，啊一个是现在监管部门对各家商业银行上报数据对吧？你的数据质量他是严格把关，有严格要求，啊出了问题需要，甚至要到这个要受到行政处罚。
02:35:20
    那么第二个就是从隐在业务，这个是个政治问题，啊绝对不能出现新增影响，或者里面出现差错明显的差错。所以也是上周在公司部和风险管理的共同努力下，我们也在逐步啊把这个事情要理顺。当然因为前期有些问题的这个叫沉淀吧我们原来这个对政府客户或者叫政府融资平台这么一个范畴，对吧？这个定义并不是很清晰，监管部门自身也不是太清晰。但随着这个15号文包括目前这个监管他的一些推出的一些新的要求，啊是吧？包括要要建系统，现在是给我们光盘，啊今后要要系统，那这些情况就会慢慢更清晰。
02:36:14
    所以我们现在的口径就是政府融资平台，这个客户，我们基本上还是按照民间的口径，是吧？就是今后是一个系统，系统里有多少我们就是多少。这目前呢是光盘。啊给我们光盘。就严格对照这张清单，也也不必扩大，我认为也不必扩大，如果说原来已经扩大了，我们可以通过今后，啊因为每个季度都要条是他们在一段时间的缓冲，把它调整，归集到这个民间的口径。
02:36:57
    嗯那么另外就是引债引债千万不能出现问题，但是在实操当中我们也发现确实也不单是银行，不不是说银行的问题，啊不仅仅是银行的问题，可能在财政端或者说投资端有一些错配啊或者说调整还没有通知银行，这个就是要要求我们银行啊一定要及时做好贷后管理啊，及时发现了，至少就是做到我们这一段我们情况要清楚，并且做到我们发放的这些所谓的隐债业务，它确实不是一家对吧？不要说你被人家调理都不知道，调进来的也不对，啊不要说无心正义的，调出去，那你的还款来源是什么？呢今后你是落空了，这个也值得警惕，所以贷后管理一定要跟进。
02:37:52
    啊所以刚才咱们各个经营单位，啊我们下一步要适当的要控制，另外所有的经营单位都要做好严格的做好贷后管理。啊近期可能公司部啊风险管理可能要来做一些检查，做一些指导，啊所以希望大家高度重视这个问题。尤其经营单位不能自行其是，不能按照在这个事情上，大家要有高度的政治敏感性，啊要紧跟，现在不是说你要去首先要紧跟分行的这个这么一个安排，分行也要及时紧跟总行包括这个监管的一些要求，对吧？你们管千万不能自行其是按照自己的理解来上报啊或者来培育，啊这个我想在这边再做一个解释，吧好我就讲这么多。
02:38:47
    好，那么今天的这个主题啊是这个会的业务的一个可持续的一个发展，啊因为呢这个普惠的这个客群呢和这个零售的这个特点呢有着这个天然的这个联系，啊所以呢唉我也说几句，啊第一个呢就是普惠的这个客群，呢部分不为个体，其实本身也是零售的重要的这个科学。那么为什么这么说呢？这个我们现在的这个普惠客户啊2000户左右，那么其中呢个人的普惠户呢大概接近1500 985左右。
02:39:26
    那么这其中呢宅基带呢是800多850部，那么这个本身呢就是个人的客户，啊那么还有1000户的这个是这个公司的这个客户，那么这些普惠的公司客户呢也主要是以这个经营负责人为核心的这么一种业务展业的这种模式。所以这个经营的主要负责人本身也是零售的重要的一个特点，而且呢我们认为呢普惠制特别特别是在这个啊是比较优质的这个客户，而且他们的金融的这个需求呢也是比较丰富。
02:40:08
    那么刚刚呢这个前面响亮的在PPT中，PPT中呢也提到了就是我们的宅基带的这个客户现在目前的在零售业务方面的一个获客的一个情况。那么这个活期呢1600万，那么其中一半在成都，那么理财基金很多的我看了一下很多经营机构问题，啊一方面呢我们在联动这方面做的不是特别好，但是另外一方面也反映我们潜力的数据。因为呢这个普惠的这个客群还在持续增长当中，如果我们按照这个今年的这个目标到年底是100亿的话，我们的普惠客群可能会增长到2500户，如果明年是50亿增长的话，可能会到3500万。
02:41:01
    所以这个格局还在高速的一个增长。唉那么我刚才也听听到有很多经营单位都在说啊就普惠的批量化的获客的来源方面做的是不太理想，但是我们的普惠客户是不是我们零售端的批量化的获客的重要来源？我认为是唉那么今年上半年呢我们的零售的m30万以上的这个客户增长了479户，啊大家想想啊如果我们的2000多户的普惠客群里面，如果有一部分能转化为我们，甚至有一部分能够转化为我们，还有30万以上的这个客群，啊那这个问题也是非常巨大。
02:41:46
    唉所以呢这个当务之急啊确实要打通界限来提升这个贡献就是这个价值。那么这个讲到这个打通这个界限提升价值呢这个里面就体现我们这个一体化的这么一个经营。双向获得双向获得就是不仅仅呢是零售总不会一条线获得，那么同时呢这个零售呢也要反复，这个不会条件符合这个不会条件的一些客户的，我们要把这相关的这个客户的零售呢向这个普惠条件去推，建立这么一个联动的这个机制，啊那么前面想想再讲了，我们建国呢前面我们也在商量，就是在这个零售部呢和这个小企业部之间，呢我认为呢是要建立这么一个联动的一个机制，而且我认为还要拿出一个最好的唉还要在近期呢要能拿出一个联动的一个方案来落地，有效的落地。
02:42:46
    啊在人员联动、业务联动、信息沟通方面，唉我们都要有所促进。这个里面呢我想呢就是有一个初步的一个目标的一个设想，啊就如果我的普惠的客群里面渗透率能达到30%的话，唉大家想一想，啊那我2000多亩，而且这个数字在不断的增长，唉那我每年的这个增长的这个速度也很快，如果渗透率达到30%，如果30万以上m的客户达到10%，啊那到明年年底我就350户，这个数字就接近我们的半年的am的新增。
02:43:30
    那么这个是我的一个设想。那么另外一个呢我认为这个方案要考虑呢互不处罚，啊啊啊分层营销啊一户一次，那么互不处罚呢体现的是一个覆盖面，就对这个群体的客户都要处罚。那么以后一次呢讲的是呢根据客户的这个需求来推产品。那么分层营销呢是指呢，我们现在目前的一个精细化的一个管理的一个举措，啊就针对包括我们的结队，包括我们的大堂经理，我们的理财经理，还有我们的这个分管的这个行长，还有我们的零售部，啊就根据这个相应的这个客户的这个情况进行分类分类了以后，呢要有一个保护的这么一个处罚，然后同时根据客户的这个需求呢能够推送有目的的去推送我们的这个零售的这个产品，啊能够达到一个争取30%的一个渗透率和10%的来源的这个客户的这么一个这个增长，啊这个是我们的一个初步的一个设想，啊一个是好，各位同事啊交流一下。
02:44:51
    上半年啊到6月末，整体上来看呢公司的一个收官情况不错，公司存款我的意思是说950亿。贷款800亿，不是100亿以上，和普惠任务是基本达到我们的目标，至少得到总行的目标去用南京的方法。还有一些这个差异，其实今天要交流的最后一周，啊我算是一个大型项目，也是我们想让我们跟这个华杰起码要有4次，4次给我报的时候不一样，啊礼拜一告诉我2,250,000,000肯定没问题，那礼拜二告诉我们22亿，噢礼拜四的时候就问了21天这个问题。
02:45:32
    所以说说明我们确实在整个普惠业务的体系化发展方面，客户的储备方面和客户结构方面，还有很多问题值得我们去去分析。第一个来讲的一点就是目标，100亿这么100亿的目标，那么可能就解决不了。实际上这样来做，我想说总行的这个KPI的任务可能跟最后下的这个任务是完不是完全一样，那么我想不管总行对我们什么，那么作为我们南京分行，我们首先已经突破100亿，是我们一个金融坚决不去动。
02:46:09
    因为从目前这个结构，呢就如果说到年底我们的代码存在840亿左右，如果说是我们这个这个普惠是吧达到100个亿，合理反应。也占到百分之十几的利润水平。对南京部门而言确实是一个非常重要的改善我们结构的不同的群体。
02:46:35
    我想主要有几个方面来讲一下整个服务业务的发展。第一个还是想跟分行的这个中航工程的份额，去年啊我们在座的各位领导，就是关于讲我们做了一个判断，达成了1个南京分行在整个下半年有10个亿的利润，10个亿的1个规模的1个项目，就去年我们顺利的完成任务。那么今年我们的新产品在哪里？但陆陆续续当然我们在公安到现在还是到目前为止，今年已经到期了，我们今年还没有，然后10个亿的5个亿左右的1个项目还没有看到。
02:47:13
    同时整个小企业可能还要对标一下，我们目前我们杭州分行就普惠业务做得比较好，而他有很多核心的点，比如说啊通过这个宅基带，通过保险公司的价值可以做到9000。那么像像这样的一个模型，我觉得我比较大一点去学去配合这样的人在市场上又产生我们新的一种东西，这个竞争力。当然今年我们在新产品方面和政策在新一代是吧？这一系列的对我们的这个那我觉得作为我们银行的一个正常管理者，不能等总行，不能靠总行。
02:47:53
    现在在总行说老实话，排队的项目分享，啊整个总行开发系统开发的能力，啊也大家也可能还是比较清楚的，如果你如果慢一点，别人快一点，能够保证兄弟的话整个业绩一个领先，所以呢我觉得我们还要高于有有高于一种地理位置的城市。这对我们项目每一步到什么什么情况这个是卫生上提的要求，就是说如果中场定不下来，就是啊我们在这一块方面就必须在下半年要尽快落地。汽车产品。第二个我们才有可能去完成我们今年是这样一个任务。
02:48:32
    第二个就是在整个平台和渠道的建设，怎么样去帮助我们的经营单位，用他们自身的资源自身的给付，去做好候客的这个就刚才其他地方有没有注意到，就是刚才我在听大家发言的过程中，我觉得还是有一些偏差。啊火龙江支行啊今年我们是在水下也是唯一一个，到目前为止，宅基带方面没有形成自己的一个渠道，我家里人只好告诉你，第二，那个永华桥就跑了27个区，那么我可能这也这也可能会错。
02:49:08
    就你一个市场人员在江阴地区，你充其量30个渠道，做精做透，一共才几个人？一靠靠终端谁做，27个学生怎么也不怎么可能做到，肯定是需要我们这个需要我们主管管理能力帮助他们，帮助他们去达到我们的需求。我相信如果你二27个学校可能跑得也很辛苦，那你如果真的是弄3个渠道把它做工作之后，效果可能有点不一样。而且刚才我还听到了在讲这个客户经理，呃抱怨客户经理这些我我也在讲的渠道建设一定是要吃好市场行为，去帮助客户给你打报告，你不可能我们附近自己去找去找自己做，而打好一个渠道之后，怎么样去管理这个渠道的问题，怎么样做好的渠道，品这个渠道到底什么样的产量都是我们管理者，这也是我们分行的管理，应该帮助我们经营单位的管理，啊轻易超过客户经理不行。
02:50:11
    举个例子，啊我觉得怎么样在我们的这个整个的产品是吧？你看4个1工程在我们的产品园区，客户担保机构，怎么样帮助我们进展来做一些工作，尤其首发，最近我们在南方开了几次，他们的这个借口接待的，这个虽然目前谈的条件比较苛刻，啊我想我们还要继续合作，是吧？把我们的条件尽量的向我们说一下，能做一点倾向。因为他们有大量的客源，因为大大数据通过行业什么样的客户，但是我说这个这段他们也他们也愿意做其他的这样的话就是我们上海银行，所以我们就客户比较少，客户经理比较少的地方是我们这个非常好的一个渠道。
02:51:01
    同时我开展了众创众创管理方面，流程的数据是非常重要的。啊请刚才常州讲的问题，就是到底我们现在三线的贷款5个人的出发是在一个业务要求。就好像上次我跟我讲的这个这个问题，我们还要再去探讨一下，我觉得我们的管理我们肯定从整个小企业全程管理方面，我从我们的开户，从我们的合伙，从我们放到最后一系列这样一种概括。
02:51:33
    如果真的一个经营单位200多户，成功业务，一个一个客户做20分钟三三十分钟，那么可能对客户经理来说也是一个是吧？产能不能释放，怎么样？我们来跟踪我们的优化，我们的优势，就审批有。对。尽量的把我们客户能够解放出来。最后也都在可能在一些重点项目跟踪方面调节，我们还需要进一步的销售。到最后一天想让他找两笔在一起唉搞了两笔票，一来搞了一个4000万，可能都有问题。
02:52:08
    所以我看这样的工作可能还是要进一步的加强这样的体系方面工作。噢最后一天来找他们，他们也很辛苦，虽然我们很愿意帮你把这个事情做好，虽然那天我是绞尽了把这个事情做好，但是就当时我找到我的感觉就完成率50%就不错，那么如果这个9000万再完不成的话，那么就这个完不成情况了。啊最后一天我们放了多少单，总行小企业可能会很紧张，那因为什么都明天一天了，差四五个亿没问题。都是搞突击到最后一天来来做问题的一个业务，那么既然大家都在搞体系，那么刚才我们讲到了很多综合化的经营，转过来做综合管理企业，我哪有条件跟你去谈这些东西，最后我要没有完成任务，哗啦哗啦什么都做了。
02:52:56
    就是我们怎么样去布局？那么才是我们的结果，是很好的一个需要水平。进一步思考问题。然后我们经营单位来说，首先刚才这个记录上也讲到了，就当地政府的一些特色的一些产业，那我觉得这今天今天我想讲的第一个，每一个地区不管南通也好，无锡也好，常州也好，当地肯定个人自己的一些问题，按照我们恰恰上海银行在借款产品，我们今天的模式，我也希望大家加强对种类的教育和研究，当地的同业在做什么，呢当地的政府很好的产品，他那个科技局来看，他们就把这个给他干了。
02:53:39
    我想向省向省里面往我们上一步的这个这些产品去去研究哪些产品可能会出现问题，那我们才能如果值得我们来做，一起要求他们做工作，我也强调一下，这也就是咱们自己分行领导靓丽的风景也好或业绩也好。那第二个就是说在我们同业里面去同意到我们做出统一做的这些产品，是不是我们是不是我们就前期我们一个小企业我们研究不出创意的话，我后来到总行去，总行就是总行这些产品呢目前的时候呢还是有一些距离，但是这个产品也在做更新，一旦这个产品如果能定下来之后，那么我们怎么样去去跟上？我们发挥出我们上海银行的特色。
02:54:38
    然后为什么别人有的我不清楚。就是想象一下。让大家再思考几个问题，就是因为时间关系，第一个我觉得自己到底有没有一个好的获客群，如果说有了一个好的产能，为什么控制的预期是不是一样？我们有没有去做一些事情？还是说我们的经营管理者就是带着客户经理去跑步的，我告诉你这么一个渠道，那后续的跟踪管理有没有帮助去发现问题问题。
02:55:14
    第二个就是说大担保公司的这个大量的这个控股怎么办？我们用什么样的产品来代替？就可以发就行了。我们看到很多代码公司百分之二三十的这个使用率，还有很多代码公司的用户批了这么多事情，怎么样去适适用？想办法用我们的产品，如果传统的确实是通过我们这个推荐他们担保的方式和跟刚才南通部长讲到的其实是一样的就是说可能担保公司业务应该没什么情况，我们怎么样用新强来代替？票可以带不行，反正你就是不能开收费票，也那天我银行卡。
02:55:51
    原被告方有补充吗？也不行，我们商行业里面的这个凭凭证去政府有没有什么要求，总要开动我们的脑子，把我们的数据写一下，到底有没有核心客户的供应链，再进一步来讲有没有犯罪的情况。我们泛核心的供应链不知道各位我清清楚楚跟总行是什么样的，央企的或者省级国资的二级到三级的子公司的这种这种怎么样形成自己的一些业务的思考，还要允许啊像上海银行这次政府的业务也是我们做了很多，如果刚刚才我看到了一些行里面写到了一个园区，我们园区保留今年下半年我们只想做3000万5000万，我觉得这另外一种要求，连续的大量的企业，大量的就是如果是我们的分管行长围绕我们二级分行，如果能够花半个月去跑两个园区三个园区，我不想肯定不止500元。
02:56:56
    关键是想想我真的想做这个事情。那么再有我们一把手的假期，我相信在园区搞这个业务，肯定能够做出我也特别很着急，啊想想让他整个目标里面基本上把这个云取保下半年的任务花了多少钱，花了10个亿。吧这个产品和谐啊是吧？的目标。
02:57:24
    按照大家目前来讲，我们怎么样去分解，怎么样怎么样然后可能再聚焦一些。就是说并不是说每个经营单位所有的线上线下产品对吧？我希望大家聚焦一点，根据自己的特色来做下去。但是线上线下两块市场并不代表着线上线下所有的产品，他有这么多人力物力，跟刚才一样的，就是刚才讲的扑克渠道一样是吧？有27个区，我一个二十几吨，一个二十几吨，那如果做不到，我们一个一个部门不会做，我这个这个南京房地产差不多，加起来差不多。
02:58:04
    6月27号很受一个执法的一种剥削，聚焦一些把我们有限的精力好大部分高一点。思考完了这些问题之后，然后我们再来看看这些结构是不是可持续。那么今年这些业务坐在这里，明年还能做，呃明年还能放心吗？明天还有一件事，不要低估分行转型的决心。
02:58:28
    啊南通农行说老实话，在6月末的时候79就给政府的这个这个不会去。我这个放的话那任务也完成了。好。谢谢所以我们前面讲到了有这么多的普惠业务，我们更更希望做一个真真实实的那么金融媒体这么一个角度，我们还是希望通过这些我们准备的客户来看一下我们这个这么多的这么多的这个业务里面有多少有多少个多少个就是后续呢我们可能在整个管理里面我们也会再做一些分享，你下面还会讲到这个队伍的建设问题。
02:59:09
    今天普惠客户经理队伍建设也是总行经理的一个重要的课题，总行就达到了一个400人左右。南京公安局你要新增15个10 15个法律事务，能够23日到18日的时候，到到到18户，目前来看二级分行目前要求要求每家是两个人是吧？9月11日。那这个问题啊我觉得第一个态度问题，有些支行还没有动，我认为也就没有完成。缺陷有多少？有些有些20平方呢是有的。有了专职的，他只是有我后面讲什么问题，呢就是第一个就这些普惠客户经理谁在管？有些二级分行把它放在营业，但从上海银行的机制来看，很多营业部就是重新梳理，啊所以也是我希望做的就是在这里，线上的这个线上的也有可能会去考虑这个问题，吧暂时不会去考虑这个问题。
03:00:15
    那我可能但是我想机构可能普惠客户经理全是两房，一个是专业化，第二个就是说工作作风，还有一些经营。所以所以说道理到底把这些客户你在什么部门，现在管刚才前面讲放在业务管理或者那个市场部的，更倾向于把更倾向于把业管部来管，啊这样至少我们这个条件管理素质第二个就是第二个就是普惠人员的渠道建设到底谁来抓？我想在二级分行层面上面，执法党组成员至少从哪里来做？就渠道建设。不要任由客户经理去做，走渠道走，所以原来走访上上海银行走访讲一下营销，所以讲呢天津我是年初呃把年末的投入都都全部要定下来了，但是我想在这里在渠道建设一定是要解决一个枪口的问题，包括比我们前后导向，经营单位的管理者的需求，让我们客户经理这样我才可以有的放矢，而不是说我们的客户经理说你去跑，你的任务就这么下来。
03:01:19
    所以说所以说我们看到今年我们整个普通客户经理的业务量，我们最低的所在建的90万。65。这个也一样，不是不行。二级分行来看一些二级分行两个客户经理基本上都是八九百万，啊多的客户经理销售，通过你们的思维，这是一个单一的压力，一个多小时一定出现了问题。就是如果花了半年的时间，我一个客户经理只做了八九百万，一定是这个问题。问题出在哪？这个可能就是说我们经营单位的管理者要去思考问题，在过程管理里面我们做哪些事情，在考核里面我们帮助客户去解决什么？呢发现了什么？然后说业绩考核我们是怎么样，而我们把这个队伍建立起来之后，那么可能我们会把我们的客户再再做一次分享，有一些原先的效果或者低效个人管理，能够去可以教会到我们为客户服务。
03:02:24
    同时我们把一些有潜力的，所以延伸管理非常好的案例啊差不多，做了一个普惠客户，然后发现一个普惠客户，外汇外汇专员根据这个投，后来我发现了这个它还有一些结算的，啊通过通过它有一些结算的话，我们来做到了这样的一些上海银行接外汇产品的这个推进，最后把他这个关联一年就按照4个亿人民币的跨境人民币计算。那这也就是说我们的普惠客户啊他们要做话题一个话题，通过我们这些客户从一个点打开一个面，是吧？从1个财经的客户，比方说4个亿人民币跨境，所以说在这个领域有可能然后再看一看我们的有效有效户只有38.22%，然后50万里面是吧，财产是50万里面，还还有很多工作值得我们时间关系。
03:03:16
    我想说的最后一章讲的就是服务业务，是这个小客户大文章，这个普惠业务，只要我们不断的坚持，不断的耕耘，不断的追求，领导也走了。那么今年在我们国家我们南京分行一定能够完成超过100亿教育。现在今天下午花了半天的时间，啊聚焦普惠的可持续可持续发展。
03:03:49
    我刚才看到我们这个部门第二个方向啊做了很好的发言。啊我感觉当中啊应该说大家还是认真的做了一些思考。而我们三个分管行长呢从各自的角度还进行了一些布置。啊我就最后我就说三句话，第一个呢我觉得啊我个人干工作的一些体会，我觉得就是数以千道以外，啊不如我们一句土话讲叫两横，一竖就是一个字，啊其实我看我们很多很多人呢就是我们在实际工作中我们大家是不是有这样的一个感觉？有些人呢就是说到了一个10的时候，到了50的时候呢的确是啊我目标也是走高一点，唉但是实际落地，你比如说刚才我们讲了，包括渠道的建设，可能包括啊业务的拓展，我们有一行去年这个项目储备，我记得我参加这个公司条件的项目不会有些行这个就过200亿，对于记录下来两个月都没到位，就是我们有时候讲故事讲的自己都不行，啊我们现在同样的也有这样的问题，我们谈业务的发展也存在，这个啊不需要大家讲这么多，我们就实实在在一个项目一个项目一件事一件事把它做好，没那么高深，人与人最大的差距，啊我认为第一个是格局，第二个就是时代。
03:05:35
    啊大家不要把这个想的那么那么玄，啊我们还有包括我们的格局里面，其实对我们一个认知的思维。啊第二句话讲的呢就是我也希望我们普惠业务的发展，希望全行大家相互之间通过交流发言，虽然希望大家可以一起启发，也有一些事，什么样的例子，一个是不走单一路，啊就是我们要多调整一点，啊我一直反感的是什么？呢我们应该如果说谈到不会，啊就是靠什么宅基地南京地区哪也走不下去。
03:06:19
    啊我们有些行可能就只坐在这里，啊因为这个那也是肯定走不下去的。那如果说我们现在做一个票据在哪？那我们全行都来推规范一点，我觉得这一条路也这么简单。啊我们现在每一个行实际上条条大路通龙马路是很宽的，啊关键是每个行你要去根据你的特点去探索。啊第二个呢我觉得讲的这句话讲的呢还是我们不要走思维固化的路，啊不要走违规经营的邪路。
03:06:56
    啊这个为什么要跟大家讲这句话？包括刚才有些发言我看了一组，遇到问题的时候，呢我们有点思维固化，谈到呢就是审批，谈到更多的我们的价格，啊其实我们在实际在市场当中，因为我们真心的感觉就我不如人千千万万，人不如我也是千千万。就是我们上海银行的产品肯定不是市场上最好的，但是我们有很多产品也是别人别的行望尘莫及的。
03:07:36
    啊你就包括我们现在做的农产品票据贷，啊现在可能有些行的创新在某些程度上超越了我们。当初我们能做成的时候，那我们不也是走在前面了吗？我们是不是去认真研究了这个市场，啊一谈到就是价格，那价格很多，那宁波银行的这个业务发展怎么发展？呢我们刚才这个基本上没有对标宁波银行他也不改，我们现在不改对标宁波银行，对吧？你们宁波银行来看看宁波银行的数字什么什么数字。
03:08:21
    唉所以我们看一看我们讲的就是我们一遇到问题就谈这个话题。有一点老调查常年其实我们现在肯定还有，但是需要看到了大家还是在不停的在磨合当中进步，包括我们的基层，啊包括我们的部门，啊都是在磨合当中逐步逐步的一步一步的进步。啊我想现在倒不是，这个是核心问题，价格也是一样，我们这个价格我们是我们有我们的客户，苏州分行，上海银行的苏州分行，现在的宅基地的一个60亿，同样的是南京分行的产品，我们一模一样是总行开发的产品，一样的价格，苏州的价格定价的水平比我们地市的定价就比较低，但是为什么我们出现了这个状况？我们不要给自己走台阶了。
03:09:21
    啊我们自己做了一个亿的宅基带，或者我们谈一谈我们跟苏州分行所以我希望啊大家看一看，还有一个为什么标准违规经营呢？我们做普惠，我上一次我记得5月份给这个各个行开会的时候讲，我一定希望大家真做普惠做真普惠。啊所以6月底很多的这个普惠的待遇，啊6月底可能审批已经批掉了，到了最后一天我是坚决不同意，我不要这样的数字，我要我们各个行首先从一把手开始，端正思想，你有没有认认真真的来思考你这个行怎么去做普惠，啊所以我们希望大家来走什么，呢我们要敢于走敢为人先，人先那种创新的一条啊就是我们创新的机会，上海银行我觉得创新的机会太多了，啊但是我们怎么去走到前面？啊我们去年的票据贷到包括到今年，现在平均的定价，这4.8啊高于市场的平均水平。
03:10:49
    我们现在也想你跟你讲，啊我们这个地区票据带走不了，没有要求分配，而且票据呢并不只有政府融资里面，他有大量的制造业，大量的其他的企业也可以说，但每个地区你给你的我们谈了几年，呢我们的专业市场啊常州也看到过南通这个专业市场实际上应该说空间很大，啊但是我们怎么去探讨我们专业市场的零售的联动，怎么去突破这一块？包括我们的园区宝，原国现在全行可能就长做了一点，无锡基本上就是一两袋，其他基本上是0，比如说我们谈我们的票据带入，我们这个地方做不了票据的，啊所以我觉得没有有人要你去做票据的，票据做不了，你可以不容易的，容易在做票据，你可以随意的，我们一定每个地方它都有生存的空间，所以为什么我们要各个行要计财部，对标的是同业，啊我们不会给大家提出一些不切实际的要求。
03:12:11
    啊第三句话啊应该讲，呢就是而是希望全行也是再接再厉，往事就是我们上半年啊归零，我们要从一开始，这个上半年我们自己定的目标存贷新增，双北啊双部门，啊这是我们自己在总行做了一个承诺，啊这个我们过去想也不敢想，啊我们实现这样的目标，啊各项指标上半年在全行的努力之下，啊应该说充分肯定我们各个行啊我们二级分行一直走在全行的前列，我们南京地区部分支行啊今年也有很大的进步，啊我们过去想也不敢想，我们实现了这样的目标，大家觉得这样的目标怎么样？唉我觉得不容易，啊也是，但是跟总行的要求项目，啊总行认为要我们对标的是江苏银行，对标的是南京银行总行，啊所以我们现在各家行，我们各家分行现在都不改，跟当地的这个江苏银行南京银行对标，啊现在总行的要求就是我们要看到江北银行南京银行，就是我们现在处于江苏的这个大地上，怎么去开拓更好的话，啊提出更好的啊所以我希望我们各家二级分行对标当地同业，啊永远是我们的一个追求。
03:13:53
    那么从这个为什么刚才我要通报一下，我们存在着艺人占比下降，一人也占比下降，我们的贷款啊下半年中下半年应该说总行还强调了很多，我们三季度啊我可能想最近公司条件会把这个指标下给大家，包括零售按揭也会给大家一个强烈的信号。那三季度我们叫什么样的答卷？啊我想三季度的利润贷款一个达标达标的压力。
03:14:33
    总的来说，我们刚才讲我们在上半年从各项指标来看，营收的增长我们已经只有3.6%，把我们的指标看看能不能营资的增长啊主要是我们的不良，是叫生息资产的减少。而今天看到我们上市公司上市银行的年报，今天我就看到两家，一个是杭州银行，一个是南京银行是吧？江苏银行都是16，都是这16 15 16。尤其我们看一个最可怕的我们宁波银行的数字，宁波银行的最终贷款新增300多亿，对公啊整个的对公贷款现在300多亿，整个存款新增1900，啊所以我们也看一看，就是每一个行啊可能都会看到当地啊还是有一些就是这个说明什么，我们不跟你不一样，啊说句实在话，我没有要求我们那个宁波银行去，啊但是看到什么呢市场是有空间的。
03:15:51
    啊今年的这个增长，江苏银行存款上半年新增1200，宁波银行是侵吞1900拿1900亿，吧南京银行也是一千几百，啊其实每家银行的数字都是一千几百亿，我们每一个地区啊大家看一看，啊看一看当中我们要找到方向，一直是说我们有时候我们就是我们要研究市场，研究同业，要知道同业在干什么，我们学习还不规范，我们即使不会创新，我们学你比如无锡分行应该提到的，宁波分行啊宁波银行在无锡5000多个客户，刚才顾客多少？1900户。啊几几千。
03:16:41
    那负荷这么多，那我们去学，啊我觉得创新就从无锡开始，啊这样一个产品咱们在无锡落地，那无锡要有这样的决心，啊需要分行需要调查，我们一起来起权力来一起来推动。啊所以我说你7月份我们可能这个全行的这个上半年的会议啊估计要到8月初啊或者7月底，应该是在8月初的可能性比较大，还是让我们各个条线，因为今天只是我们普惠条件做了一些交流和发言。
03:17:20
    那么今天上午总行啊所有业务条件啊都做了一些交流，啊都做了一些发言。总的来说总行的要求啊参加这个会，今天我们所有的部门老总都参加了，他说没有经营部门的，不管经营部门老总参加了，大家感受到是什么？没有任何道理可讲，只有两个字发展，发展不了，就是不行。好，那今天的会议啊就到此。对。

    We hold the July meeting, and the theme of this monthly meeting is the discussion on inclusive finance. Why did I choose such a theme? This morning, we also attended the meeting held by President Zhu of the head office of the first half of the year, especially the meeting of the head office of the head office, as well as our relevant departments.
00:00:29
    From this meeting, we should say that we fully feel the high target positioning, higher targets, stricter requirements of the head office, or at the same time demand this stronger role. Ah, we also feel that the head office is facing tremendous pressure during the operation and management process. Ah, according to our picture, more people may not sleep. Ah, especially when we benchmark against the data of our peers. The head office, we fully feel that the head office should be more anxious. Against this background, I hope our inclusive financial development today, our discussion, ah, we need all the banks to be more pragmatic and more active.
00:01:30
    Ah, the head office meeting this morning, I think the housing construction bank actually is more looking forward to, because there can&apost be any slack thinking, we must really do our work, do well in the third quarter, ah, perhaps because the head office in the third quarter, from the retail side, may be irresponsible. Ah, because of the pressure, and this year we&aposve seen major interbank banks, Bank of Jiangsu, Bank of Nanjing, Bank of Ningbo,
00:02:04
    The growth rate of all indicators of Hangzhou Bank, including Minsheng, has exceeded 10%. So there&aposs a huge pressure on us to change in this context. Ah the second aspect is the third quarter ah, should say emphasize the overall development, more value credit, our assets business placement. So this inclusive finance is actually a big part of our asset business, especially our third quarter, and I think it&aposs a top priority.
00:02:41
    Ah, so today, in general, the topic of inclusive finance, I think when the various sectors are speaking, I think a focus is on inclusive sustainability. The second one I think is a standard, this is the standard by which we evaluate each line. It&aposs the percentage of your inclusiveness, the growth rate of your inclusiveness, and we&aposre better.
00:03:10
    In fact, we all have such a relevant figure now. In general, the proportion of our industry in the local industry is 0.8 in Nanjing, 1.23, and 1.59 in the south-east. Changzhou area is 1.86, we Yancheng area is 1.5 liters, each area actually your loan in the local proportion? How many banks do we have, we are inclusive in the local area, is lower than our loan ratio, and now according to the Bank and Insurance Regulatory Bureau,
00:03:54
    The requirements of Jiangsu Banking and Insurance Regulatory Bureau and Shanghai Banking and Insurance Regulatory Bureau for us, and the requirements of Shanghai Banking and Insurance Regulatory Bureau for the head office, the strategy of achieving inclusive finance as soon as possible is to reach 10%. Last week, Jiangsu Banking and Insurance Supervision Bureau also told us that our current ratio of inclusive benefits among all local city commercial banks ranked, we still established the last three.
00:04:20
    Although we are making steady progress, our technologies are different. So this proportion is the only criterion for our country&aposs evaluation, including your growth rate, which I think is a criterion. Before today&aposs meeting, I also spoke to the Ministry of Small Business. I said that our materials for 8 years of this year are mainly from four perspectives. The first is the Ministry of Small Business and Approval, including our risk management. From the perspective of midfield departments of branches, we should talk about how to enable them, how to promote them, how to effectively manage products, and how to control them more effectively. This is the effect of mid- and long-term departments.
00:05:13
    The second is from the perspective of operating units. We emphasize more on adapting measures to local conditions, because now small businesses may be involved. We have a lot of products, and now there are probably six categories of products. I don&apost ask every line to have to be fully developed, but some basic products, ah you have to have a touch, ah not a line of land regulations to develop more and more clean, ah that is extremely dangerous. Ah, so I think it&aposs the second benchmarking that we emphasize. We, this morning, our relevant departments attended the meeting of the head office, and we feel that the head office now wants our banks to have a higher target positioning, and you should align with the local peers. Ah, we are now each branch, we hope that when we speak next, each branch of our secondary branch, you should benchmark with the local peers, see if we have a gap, how far we have a gap.
00:06:26
    So from the figures for the first half of this year, because the market share at the end of May was data at the end of June, we looked at the decline in the cost share of our regions, which is normal. We have five regions, four secondary branches plus one Nanjing area, the deposit share decreases, the loan share decreases, Changzhou Branch Yancheng Branch.
00:07:07
    Ah, but we should see our Nantong Branch and Wuxi Branch, ah, it seems that we can speak these two days, Nantong Branch and Wuxi, the ratio of inclusive loans may be in the bottom of the local I estimate, ah, the development is extremely uneven. Therefore, I hope that we will give our level-2 branches a speech. We should adapt measures to local conditions and align management team building. We may focus on key. The second and the third are what angle we should stand for. From the perspective of continuous operations, we should talk more about how to achieve inclusive and comprehensive operations and professional topics.
00:07:52
    More often than not, we don&apost, we can&apost limit ourselves to doing universal service. According to our plan, the balance of our inclusive loans is expected to reach 100 by the end of this year, which is a large proportion of our 80 billion-dollar loans to the public. Ah, this $10 billion should give us some more commonalities. Ah, I have also done some analysis on the related data, which is really worrying. We sometimes wonder where our customers are coming from, and at least our retail customers are our effective customers.
00:08:37
    How do we catch the linkage? Ah, that&aposs where I need all of us, too. That&aposs the third. In the fourth aspect, I think we should still stand from the point of view of process management. How can we look at the high level (quality ) that promotes our Inclusive Benefit business? The high quality  is two, one is the high quality  sustainable, and the second is the high quality  of business, which is my compliance and risk overall reliable.
00:09:08
    The second aspect of composition management is high efficiency. This is also for our mid- and back-office departments, not only for Nanjing, but also for our comprehensive departments in February, how to achieve high efficiency. Ah, third, I think process management is more of a good structure. As mentioned earlier, the development of inclusive business requires more comprehensive and balanced development and sustainable development. Ah, so I hope that when we all speak, key will focus on these four angles to solve your problems.
00:09:49
    What about the general arrangement of today&aposs meeting? First, we invite the Ministry of Small Business to speak on a special topic, and then we invite our secondary branch to do education and exchange, because today we have another one to invite our Wuxi branch to Jiangyin branch to open nearly six months ago. The overall application is promoted as a key, so the order of my speech today, the order of the secondary branch is Changzhou Branch Nantong Branch, and then the Longjiang Branch Jiangning Branch, I say the second topic is not extreme. Ahh, do two things, do some overall talk.
00:10:32
    Finally, please ask our three leaders to promote the development of Inclusive-Wide business from the perspective of how to ensure the compliance of Inclusive-Wide business, control of risk, and compliance of business. We mainly talk about the linkage of our inclusive business. Actually, our key is about how to continue to accelerate the continuous development, ah, sustained growth.
00:11:11
    First of all, I would like to invite Governor Li of Small Businesses and colleagues. I represent the Finance Department of Small Businesses to make a report. The topic of the report is to focus on the sustainable development of inclusiveness and high quality , and promote the balance of inclusive loans in branches to increase by 10 billion yuan. The report mainly consists of three parts. First of all, let&aposs review the business situation of the first half of the year. By the end of June, the balance of inclusive loans of branches reached RMB 7.556 billion, a net increase of RMB 2.063 billion over the beginning of the year, and the proportion of loans increased to 7.25%. Well, in the first half of the year, seven operating units basically completed the target, we continued the time, progress, and unfinished, one of which was negative growth. From the perspective of operating units, we also found a law, that is, the larger the base, the faster the development. The deployment and balance of our Changzhou branch, Yancheng branch, still maintain high growth, and the balance of our sales department, Jianye branch, in Nanjing, far exceeds the trend. Judging from the growth of the number of households, we have listed Taizhou Branch separately. Why? Our Taizhou Branch is now preparing for the competition in the first half of the year. The number of households is 18, and we have more than five operating units. It may be quick to catch up with a deployment of some secondary branches.
00:12:37
    In terms of scale, the inclusive balance of R&amp;D is nearly 2 billion yuan, which may be a new height for us. The inclusive balance of Jianye Group is nearly 500 million yuan, which may be used as a benchmark for our secondary branch and one of our branches in Nanjing. Well, from the two products, this year is our homestead belt and bill belt two products of a separate plan and a separate target, our current balance breakthrough is to break through 2 billion yuan. Well, basically under the circumstances that we cooperate with the approval department and the operation management department, we now maintain the capacity of residential base station at more than 100 million per month, but only Changzhou Branch has completed the trend progress of residential base station loan 673,478. I think the reason for summing up is that I don&apost think there&aposs enough, there&aposs not much to do. The homestead loan business in Nanjing is well developed, and the five operating units exceed the schedule. I think this is mainly due to the effect of the homestead special person, and someone will arrange a special person to do it. I went down to do this thing and found that it could be done better.
00:13:44
    The effect of incremental expansion is not obvious, mainly relying on provincial guarantee, but now our other projects, such as JD Marine and Comprehensive, have made breakthroughs, but they are not as expected. The total balance is 1,354 billion yuan. Of course, there is a non-universal problem of 200 million. The non-universal problem of 200 million is a problem left over from last year. This year, we can replace it. Maybe we have a space of 200 million. Nantong, Changzhou, Taizhou and Longjiang are in the bill belt on the breakthrough, this business is still to do. The second aspect is a major problem with inclusive finance. In general, the first is that the inclusive development of branches has entered a period of attack, and the scale is getting bigger and bigger, which we have never seen before, and the head office&aposs indicators are actually getting heavier and heavier. Therefore, we need to make up for some weaknesses as soon as possible to support the rapid and sustainable development in the future. We also face three mismatches in our development. The leader summarized that the first one is that the scale and team building in business do not match. We may reach 10 billion. If we say one, if we reach 100 million, we will reach 100 million. I don&apost think it&aposs reasonable to have a professional team to support it.
00:15:01
    The second is that the development path does not match the sustainable growth rate. The original goal is to achieve the target. The combination of our comprehensive marketing contribution and localization is not enough. The third is that the integrated operation does not match the professional capabilities and the systematic support. In four specific aspects, the first is that the pressure on inclusiveness is increasing, which may be evidently felt by all operating units. In our department, we can also feel that it is becoming more and more difficult to complete secondary branches, which we would not have existed before. It is relatively easy for secondary branches to complete, but this year, it is really not easy to complete this index. In Nanjing, these two paths are relatively simple. In fact, there are data dedicated personnel for HP and HP, and there are many more protections. The construction of the HP and HP teams is urgent. It&aposs hard to catch up, especially in our regulatory notice, that our size and proportion of local banks are still lagging behind, and other banks are growing rapidly.
00:16:03
    Fourth, the structure of business is also being optimized, including our strategic strict control of business in the first half of this year. We hope that level-2 branches will form an business dependency on level-2 branches. We&aposre still trying to figure out how to get the keydomains product solution in Inclusive Manufacturing and Kechuang, or further this is obviously insufficient. The next page is a comparison of our local branches, including our entire branches and our local branches in the same sector, which is the end of June. But the regulation should be more May, May a number, ah, you can take a look. We include Nanjing and the whole branch. Only Yancheng and Hailong have the same proportion as those in the local area. In other areas, there is a big gap, right? Maybe we&aposre probably less than a fraction of the average, uh, around zero.
00:17:01
    Therefore, I think tier-2 branches should also take this proportion as an important target. It is important for us to formulate our own goals and plans, improve our own goals, and when we can catch up to a unified level. It&aposs more planned. Because this percentage, although the progress is relatively rapid, but the gap with the industry is really hard to bridge. The third part is to focus on the direction of inclusive finance in the second half of the year, and to focus on the four areas mentioned by President Lee, we will promote sustainable and high inclusive finance. While achieving the 10 billion target, we are divided into four targets: target scale, target proportion, product target, and other targets. This is a more quantitative indicator.
00:18:01
    Specifically, the first is to push the middle-class negative energy capabilities. The first aspect is to increase product innovation and strategy, and product innovation and optimization. Now, we have made a plan at the beginning of this year to achieve the goal of 4 billion, right? Even at that time, there was a plan, including improving the easy-to-loan credit, brake installment, right? There are also some new products. From now on, we may not have done well in our department. That is to say, the planned commercial vehicle phase. I thought that maybe a billion-dollar commercial vehicle could not go live. This may also be related to the market environment, right? Including a requirement with this partner, our new energy vehicle this year, right? Even hotter are new energy vehicles, and traditional vehicles will also be affected. Our goal for the second half of the year is to go live with one or two new products and projects, and we&aposre still developing around unsuitable products that can be used by all branches of our bank. If we want to support a rapid growth every year, I think we need a product line or project to support this goal. This is the responsibility of our department, and I will continue to work in this direction.
00:19:25
    Only branches now have more and more products, but the whole product system is still not responsible. Therefore, we should also sign up for more product innovation and continuously enrich our product preparation. In this product system, we should try our best to increase our product innovation, optimize our product processes, and provide us with universal access to business units. A product that better integrates with the local customer base. Therefore, the following is our list of branches, that is, our department, may be speeding up the progress now, some of us are within the year, and we still need to ensure the go-live. In the second aspect, our department should take the lead in the work of borrowing channel resources for the big platform. We should take the lead in doing well in the work of negotiating, approving, and coordinating development and operation of channel resources. There are four channels. The first one is to get customers in batches. I won&apost say much about this just now, including the fact that we have recently signed agreements for environmental protection. Here, there are a lot of leading host groups. We also hope that the organizers can take into account the overall situation, and that the products can be universal, right? We can do it all together. The second is the guarantee company channel. Previously, we did the first guarantee company trustlist centralized marketing access, ah, but now it seems that we can cooperate with all the cooperation.
00:20:47
    Well, we&aposve recently been combing through the trustlist of the second batch of guarantee companies, and we&aposve found that there are 12 companies in the Yancheng area, and the local regulatory rating is ab. There are too many state-owned guarantee companies. There are 10 companies. I think this is the second batch of companies that can go to the operating units to access the network. In Nanjing, there are four companies that have been connected one after another, and we are writing materials for access. The second is that our department should take the lead in activating the guarantee company of key, mainly at the provincial level. The other is Guoxin in Baohe Province. We should ensure that we are cooperating well with our subsidiaries. This year, we should use the amount under guarantee. Including this, like the National Day. The third is the core enterprise supply chain, which is the operating unit or the ticket area. This year, the model of credit grant and acceptor in the city was implemented in the second quarter of Changzhou Branch, and I think it is also a core enterprise. Well, other business units have several modes, or you have to learn to use this product as soon as possible. The fourth one is the cooperation park. We have continued to promote the implementation of business, but the effect is not obvious. We have also made breakthroughs, including the sales department in Nanjing. We have successfully promoted the signing of a headquarters team. You don&apost need to talk about it one by one, because the percentage is larger.
00:22:07
    Third, from the perspective of risk management, we hope to do a good job in co-management of multiple departments, such as compliance and technology risk. We focus on many departments. We focus on the key product link (ID: risk) of the domains product link (ID: key). In the past, the scale was small, but the number of risk was small, which may be because we did not emphasize much on this issue. This time, it may be due to the recent situation, and some analysis, so we hope that we can do well. Ah, the branches are mostly stock market flows, but you want everyone in the business unit to know risk, and you have to be afraid of risk. Ah, it&aposs because it&aposs true that there&aposs a large number of households, but alas, the large one will certainly come out. But we have to stick to our, uh, bottom line. Then we&aposll start with these links. We&aposll need a flow from each department, and we&aposll need a flow from key to key, and some domains to risk. Here&aposs a simple, uh, I&aposll mention that in the near future, it&aposs probably something you need to pay attention to. First, in terms of agent sales, we should strictly control the source of customer acquisition. For some channels of account managers, we may need to get involved in the channel. That is, we need to understand the real situation of the channel.
00:23:27
    The second is to ensure the effectiveness of due diligence, and what happens to us? It&aposs a case of losing a lawsuit, and the first hand may try not to cause this mortgage to be invalidated. The third is a verification of the marital status. key is a divorce for us, the State Council member, and the borrower is a divorce, which can be verified through Alipay or the Sufu office. If you still can&apost find it, you may still ask to go to the civil affairs bureau to check, if it&aposs still right? If the Civil Affairs Bureau does not cooperate or cannot do this, we may not do this. There is also a second step, in the centralized operation phase, which is supported by previous checks and checks and laws and regulations, we are also doing a reception operation in the reception phase of business, asking the customer to sign. This is also right, our account manager is equivalent to risk ah, this is the restriction that my account manager does not want to have this kind of intermediaries, alas there is any intercourse, economic related.
00:24:42
    Then, the last part of the purchasing process is that multiple departments are required to manage compliance in several aspects. In terms of operating units, we also need to further improve the number of capabilities operating units. One is to use the product and activate the channel above, uh need to be little by little, including in the improvement above need to be little by little to improve. Each business unit should have a clear direction, goal and path, and a team capable of fighting. Well, first of all, I think we need to adapt measures to local conditions, make good use of products, and combine local conditions. We need to continuously enrich product operations. All in all, it&aposs just a big technology product, right? This has to be able to do, and there is a special product to be able to do, if you know how to do it, don&apost keep one or two products, right? To become too dependent. Second, on the activation channel, my business unit reminds me that there may be a common situation of heavy construction and light maintenance, which lacks a daily interconnection review. Basically, this building is rarely seen by me. It is possible that we all think that the customers of H2jian will keep coming, and the cooperation may be relatively shallow.
00:25:46
    The third one is to continuously improve the productivity of Inclusiveness based on level-by-level benchmarking. key is the per capita productivity of account managers. You can also take a look at some account managers who are now doing more and more control. Some account managers are doing more and more control. I see if there is any movement, right? This control is still relatively small. Let&aposs look at the following two tables. The first one is on the application of the universal product. I think this product is because we don&apost go to other advanced solutions. Look at our own solutions. Probably the best thing to do is a benchmark for everyone, right? We have operating units for each product, and each operating unit is doing very well. If each operating unit can make efforts on each product, it is also sufficient to support the current development of this operating unit. The next table is the production capacity of the returned personnel in each operating unit. You can also take a look at it. That is, the per capita production capacity is uneven, and Changzhou is high. We conclude that it is probably due to this all-employee marketing, and it is mainly offline business. The yearly high is due to the online business achieved mass acquisition, high guest Nanjing area, it may also be more due to the special management of offline homestead business.
00:26:56
    Therefore, I think the improvement of production capacity is a strategy of several parties, that is, from the point of view of products, or is it an improvement of offline standardization business plus online synchronization of business. Online business and we&aposre going to go online with some more popular products, right? Alas, offline standardization, we think it may be possible to achieve 25 per capita in the second period. Because from our topic, we may have reached 55 even today, and there are five people in this 50 or more households. Is it possible that we set a target of 20 per capita and 50 full-time employees? This is indeed an issue that we may often talk about. It is really an objective situation. We can improve our per capita productivity and inspire both online and offline. I think this space is not enough at this stage or in the next two years. You can also take a look at the table on the left. In fact, we are full-time account managers who have been working for more than half a year. The per capita feedback has reached 66, or about 66, and the advanced industry may be 40 to 50. Therefore, we now upgrade the offline standardization and the online business synchronization. This should be a path to improve management and control.
00:28:11
    The second is that I think from the perspective of operating units, we should raise the awareness of proactive marketing of inclusive finance, and the next step is that we&aposll talk about this drift loan, which is based on the provincial guarantee, which is based on the provincial guarantee, which is based on the provincial guarantee. It was last year when we got a loan and we started working together, and because we had a first-mover advantage, maybe we were in the same class, so I was a teacher who dropped me out of class, right? We&aposre all waiting for the class, but this year, other banks are working together, and they&aposre going to build backwards, and they&aposre going to be watching more closely than we are. Therefore, we find that this year, in fact, our ticket now, save the guarantee of business growth pressure is quite strong, so we also hope to use the same example, ah, more still need the proactive marketing, the proactive role, right? What we did last year could be a burden, and if we don&apost do it, I&aposm going to be around $700 million, if we go to the customer, right? It&aposs probably a lot of pressure, because it&aposs only as if the initiative is in our hands. 21 have been sorted out by this acceptor, right? I think this 26 hundred has already been put in place, so I&aposm probably going to decide, right? The subsequent growth of the business one by one, alas, including the pattern and maturity management, also needs to be further managed.
00:29:29
    The third is to strengthen the responsibilities of management at all levels. I think there are still two deficiencies in the management of the operating units now, one is missing, one is missing, the next page. One is a lack of process management. We don&apost pay enough attention to process management, and we don&apost have enough strength to rely on the end of the month to call the indicators. Each operating unit also reported this guarantee to us at the meeting at the beginning of the month, but now we find that it may not have been basically completed. You can look at this guarantee. We put a figure behind this at the end of this month. We used to allocate another 50 million to the 30 million tasks of the operating unit. Draw another 200 million again, and now we still rely on this last few days to buy again, we invested 525 million in the last two days of March, and 558 million in June, and there&aposs a final adjustment to your topic. I think it&aposs too late for this time, right? This situation might have been better if it had been put before. The second is a lack of hierarchical management, which is that I think it&aposs hard to manage the people in charge, and I think it&aposs necessary to invest more time, more time, and more energy than in the past. The management department may also need a more refined management on the follow-up process of business.
00:30:45
    Well, let&aposs take Changzhou Changzhou Changzhou and I&aposd like to talk about Changzhou, especially our Eric Xu, for example, but we&aposre in the area and all the way, I think we&aposre paying a lot. We will take the lead in communicating with us about every step of the process and problems encountered here. There is a business Mgmt Dept to take the lead. Then we may work with the Credit Line Approval Dept to solve such problems one by one. The impairment band process will be smoother. Now we may have to often counter-reflect that I&aposm in business, maybe I&aposm in a mess, and we also feel that this is not going well and that is not going well, so we are also welcome to the business units to give us a block to solve this problem. Don&apost be afraid to react. The third aspect is to improve the construction of the regional operation mechanism. On the one hand, it is to accelerate the professional operation. On June 19, the head office held a meeting to classify public customers. The meeting was attended by all leaders. The head office, including the chairman and president of the head office, took part in such a process. In general, this is a process of starting the professionalization of such an inclusive team. Judging from the branch&aposs plan to build the inclusive team, this is the platform this year, you now have 18 people, including the internal transfer, outside already 10 people, including the new leader of the party college student league, and the decision will be made first, right? Therefore, I just talked about the scale of 10 billion yuan. If there was no dedicated poverty-relief team, I think it would be even more difficult in the future.
00:32:15
    You know, from a case where I went to the Yancheng gas station, we found it hard to do it before the reception, right? Even our business big family is small, right? It may not make much a month, but the full-time team has two people to transfer ownership, now one person in place, last month earned 10 million, right? Reserves early this month already reserves more than 10 million years, I think this year through the full-time homestead belt can be done, but other departments and other operating units should have no problems. Right? From the perspective of the whole account manager, that is, all account managers, the number of protection employees exceeds 25 per person is 30, and the number of protection employees exceeds 25 is 24. Therefore, there is no professional team to undertake such work. It&aposs all up to the account manager of this company, and the pressure is increasing, and the growth pressure will also increase. What&aposs not necessary is that we can now configure this situation, and we ask each operating unit to provide support and deploy it as soon as possible. According to the requirements put forward at the beginning of this year, in terms of inclusive team building, I think there are three main aspects on the next page. The first one is that the team needs to be built, which is beyond doubt.
00:33:20
    However, we may not go to another point of view, that is, we think that our inclusive development depends on the inclusive strategy. For Bank of Shanghai, we may still have to focus on business and access to achieve inclusive development, right? We don&apost have a one-size-fits-all approach or one-step approach. Our teams are divided into three categories. We have made a solution for a team, a solution for an assessment of an inclusive team, and we have also mentioned some ideas. This includes further subdivision of the team, which I think can be referred to. The second one is on the Internet, after our full-time team is built, it&aposs not just about making loans, right? The head office&aposs positioning is also to do customer management, right? As for the management warehouse, there are loan warehouses and non-loan warehouses. Therefore, the operating unit can assign some existing small and micro settlement customers of the five full-time account managers who are not under the control of the account managers to account managers for a comprehensive operation. The third is the way of performance appraisal, which can be combined with our existing basic pay-per-bill system and secondary branches to do some differentiated appraisal.
00:34:29
    The last one is the training of the account manager team, the responsibility for staff training. What about my business unit in the branch, especially the level-2 branch? After the existing team is in place, I still hope that this management responsibility should be clarified. At the current stage, it is considered that the business Mgmt Dept should directly manage and promote the service. If there is no owner, can the business Mgmt Dept owner take over the job to promote the service? Because there is no owner to promote the development of the service, because they may have a lack of management. It is hoped that the HQ has initiated a systematic training for all products, the business process, and all aspects this year. Alas, we will also notify you to attend the training. We hope that we can combine some special training in the branch to form a combat force within the year. The next aspect is to promote the integration of a business, you can take a look at the inclusive, I&aposm just doing loans, right? We&aposve done a statistics on inclusive lending, debt payment, settlement, and integrated financial services. So we can see here that in the traditional aspect, the average retention rate for the public should be 12, and in fact the deposit rate has reached 24, but the proportion of the public effective account is low. We also analyze that it is possible that the proportion of effective households in the first place may be low, and a very important reason is that our online business, including coupon loans and house price management, is more than 300. Well, this may be after the withdrawal, it may be directly given to this, and then the external payment will be made. Let&aposs bring up an idea here, that is, the ticket-like online business, where the withdrawal will not be made into the account on the same day. You can also withdraw cash to your account the next day.
00:36:12
    This one-day schedule is working for us, and it&aposs probably a help. The second is to take us to an analysis from an individual homestead, and the next step is not to be personally this comparison is more obvious, right? It&aposs more likely that it&aposs lending, that&aposs the use of our average daily deposits, including some of our retail products, and that&aposs a relatively small number. So I think we have had in-depth communication with the retail department and Mr. Lu. I think there may be two aspects: one is to attach importance to the corporate account manager&aposs thinking, and the other is to do it or not to do it. Perhaps we also discuss whether professional people do professional things, more people with retail conditions to market this marketing of a product. Actually, it may be one or two conditions to do this well. We also provide an idea for the company&aposs leaders, one is to integrate the business, or to gain customers and two-way integration.
00:37:09
    On the next page, I put forward a general idea of corporate linkage. I think we should pay more attention to this level, including that we may come up with two lines in the future, and use the product penetration rate as a differentiated appraisal of a configuration of Inclusive and Benefit. Including maybe having one of the contacts in this retail line do the ledger, one-to-one-market, right? Make a two-way and two-way appraisal for a product, including the linkage mechanism of the line. You can also refer to this. We will further refine the following two conditions. The next page is a review of the process, or does the process need to be well connected and the division of labor between the two conditions is clear, and the marketing target is not limited to the borrower, which includes spouses, shareholders, children and friends. I think this can be incorporated into the goal of this integrated operation. The last aspect is the construction of a mechanism to further improve the performance of the second half of the year.
00:38:12
    The first one is the dynamic adjustment mechanism. The second one is the differentiated configuration and development configuration. We perform a step-by-step configuration based on the satisfaction of the product. Right? Depending on the difficulty of the product, it is certain that the market resource allocation or resource allocation is different. The third is to increase the subsidy for FTP. For the operating units that have completed the competition target for the balance of inclusive financial loans by the end of the year, the standard competition means in the second half of the year will grant a profit subsidy of 15 bp. This is to further increase the subsidy. Finally, we need to strengthen the constraints on performance appraisal. For the indicators that are not completed at key time points, our leadership team will still have performance. In the future, we can have negative growth. We need to increase this penalty, which may be aggravating. The last thing I want to say is to thank all departments and business units for their support. We may focus more closely on business units in the second half of the year, but this will not take up the same big picture as this demonstration. Please understand and support us. I hope that with the concerted efforts of all of us, we can achieve the goal of 10 billion dollars in inclusive finance in the second half of the year. Thank you.
00:39:23
    The head office&aposs target for Nanjing Branch this year, the development of Guibusiness is 10 billion yuan this year, and 110 means that we will increase 45 percent this year. We think that if we want to achieve inclusive and sustainable development, Ah, we may call this idea of integration, specialization and diversification, I think it may never be moved.
00:39:55
    Against this background, we think the whole bank has also proposed that we have a project-based promotion, for example, our ticket machine loan last year, and a similar project-based one, including this year, is in the normal state. There may be some pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industry real estate products, including piecemeal ones. Without a billion dollars a year, it&aposs hard to meet the head office&aposs requirements for sustainable development.
00:40:27
    Therefore, I also proposed that each tier-2 branch of our company must cooperate with each other in a project of RMB 1–21–200 million in principle. I think this is an indispensable path to achieve sustainable growth. Second, we still have to think of taking shortcuts in the later stages. As I said earlier, in the past year, I can cope with the two or three billion yuan of inclusive benefits, and I can also cope with the last rush at the end of the month.
00:41:06
    So far, the thinking of taking shortcuts has been impossible. We have to do our work. Therefore, we need to have a mechanism in place in this area, and we need to have some matching appraisals. Now, by the end of this year, the total number of 2000 households in our bank will be reduced to 2500 or 2500 if we don&apost have a professional team to do this.
00:41:42
    Ah, that&aposs why we&aposre thinking about it. Of course, especially for our Nanjing solution, I think the growth rate of the HQ&aposs PW business to Nanjing Bank from next year may not be less than RMB 5 billion. In the future, it may be normalized. I cannot guarantee whether RMB 5 billion can meet the requirements of the HQ. Ah, but with our growth of $5 billion, can our strategy be improved? Because what do we have to face in the South? At any time, we should not shake the fundamental position of our large and medium-sized loan placement, especially our government&aposs. Anyway, we now emphasize that I think there are two steadfast, one steadfast, and the other effective asset placement for the whole bank. Ah, especially with some of our effective infrastructure projects, which at this stage is our foundation.
00:42:46
    If we have this foundation, then we need to make a higher effort than we do personally to improve our percentage. Ah, second, our determination to upgrade the four major financial strategies is unshakable. Our four major financial institutions are now the most core financial institutions, and the head office has also increased the proportion of 2017,00 in our appraisal. However, in the first half of the year, except that the proportion of inclusiveness has improved ideally, the proportion of other financial institutions is not satisfactory.
00:43:21
    Our science and technology finance is the bottom one in the whole bank at present. Our medium- and long-term manufacturing industry accounts for a relatively low proportion of artists. So I really hope that you can accelerate development and adjust the structure transformation. How can you take all aspects into consideration? Okay, so let&aposs ask the secondary branch to speak to our urban sub-branch. Ah, first of all, Changzhou branch. Good afternoon, colleagues.
00:43:57
    On behalf of Changzhou Branch, I will make a special report on the situation of Fugui Finance. According to the requirements of this branch, I will make one report from four aspects as follows. The following report is the completion status of Inclusive Welfare business in the first half of the year. As of June 2022, the balance of inclusive loans in Changzhou Branch was 1,459 million, a net increase of 388 million from the beginning of the year, and the number of loans in Changzhou Branch was 398, a net increase of 60 from the beginning of the year. The percentage of competition from the third key product in the Inclusive Competition Balance is 46%. Inclusive loans as a percentage of full-calibre loans excluding discount were 7.06, up 1.83 percentage points from the beginning of the year. From the business structure, first of all, from the customer structure, the loan balance of state-owned enterprises is 608 million, accounting for 41.7% of the inclusive balance, and the loan balance of non-state-owned enterprises is 851 million, accounting for 58.3%. Looking at the product structure of product reserves 21, 1994, we have a convenient balance of 3.59, accounting for 24.59%, 24.723, 32%, and 89.0 million, accounting for 6.06%. The balance of the online loan was 91 million, accounting for 6.2%, the loan was 22.57% on 13.29, and the loan was 78 million, accounting for 5.31%.
00:45:33
    The second part is to take a look at the pricing of Inclusive business in the first half of the year. The weighted average loan price of Changzhou Branch is 14.16. Compare the price from the following two dimensions. First, let&aposs look at the product. Our electrolytic nitrogen is 33.91, 4.27 at the reception, 4.2 on the silver certificate, 4.34 on the line supply chain, 4.32, and 3.73 on the low risk. Compared with peers, the average price of inclusive loans of Bank of Jiangsu Changzhou Branch is between 4.2 and 4.3%, and the type of mortgages generally does not exceed 4%, and the average price of inclusive loans of Bank of Nanjing Changzhou Branch is between 4 and 4.05%. The price of a home loan is generally 3.7% to 3.85 percent or more, and such a deposit is a credit product, and we&aposre a comprehensive income picture of the business in this area. As of the end of June, 86 corporate accounts were opened in the host business entities, with a total of 6.67 million deposits. As of the end of June, the deposit balance of our individual customers is 9.08 million yuan, the wealth management balance is 4.66 million yuan, and the fund balance is 1.9 million yuan.
00:46:55
    Well, that&aposs basically a problem with the development and pricing of Pratt &amp; Whitney business in the first half of the year. First of all, the proportion of state-owned capital is high, and the structure needs to be optimized. The proportion of state-owned capital in branch reserve loans reached 41.7%, down by nearly 3 percentage points at the end of the quarter, but still up by 3.5 percentage points compared with the beginning of the year, just as the proportion of online supply chain accounts for less than 10%. Second, the coverage of products is relatively low, resulting in a limited number of business deposits, finance, and fund delivery. Take residential reception as an example. By the end of June, residential reception customers accounted for only 41.5% of the total number of open households and nearly 5.3% of the deposit-loan ratio. The third block is about the work of Inclusive &amp; Whitney business. The goal of this year&aposs work is to specify that the competition for the Inclusive &amp; Whitney balance this year is not less than 700 million, of which the competition for house reception is about 181.8 million and the competition for proofs is about 12.12 million. The guarantee company&aposs guarantee for business increased by 200 million yuan, and the online supply chain increased by 15.18 million yuan. The number of inclusive customers is not less than 100, and the number of online customers is not less than 30, and the proportion of inclusive loans is increased by 1.5 percentage points.
00:48:16
    The second one will increase the benefits of inclusive integration. The first step is to strengthen corporate linkage, improve the coverage of inclusive customers in products such as personal deposit and wealth management funds, and assign dedicated personnel to perform statistics and analysis on data to provide a decision-making mechanism for tiered pricing. The third is to protect the assets of Inclusive and Inclusive, we will continue to do a good job in managing the key links of Inclusive loans, ensure the growth of loans, and strive to maintain zero non-performing loans. Fourthly, we will discuss the financial work of Inclusiveness. To achieve the above objectives, the branch will ensure the sustainability of Inclusiveness by improving channel construction, enhancing product promotion, and improving refined management. The measures are as follows: First of all, deep exploration of incremental customers. There are about 1,300 local customers in the branch, and only 35% of the credit customers are granted. One existing customer in the central bank comprehensively sorted out valid accounts and assigned to people without debt. The responsible person is required to keep in touch regularly. Seize the opportunity of business in this time, increase the frequency of visits to credit line customers, get an in-depth understanding of the enterprise, expand upstream in-depth, obtain the opportunity of re-lending through high-quality services, optimize the scheme setting in the re-lending process, and transform to a single supply chain, and break through the region. 5 more customers now.
00:49:37
    At present, more than 30% of the new customers are received by the branch through transfer. The first ticket loan is from a common loan to a multi-product value to get such a ticket loan business real ticket loan business. The second is to strengthen cooperation with guarantor institutions and pay attention to the role played by guarantor institutions in the PFC business. In addition to the traditional businessbusiness, cooperation is deepened through products such as silver certificates, separate forms, and guarantee notes. Currently, the branch&aposs separate L/G is an entry point for the core enterprise of developing cooperative bills. The L/G has been downgraded to 40 million, and the balance of the separate L/G exceeds 50 million, driving the company&aposs business revenue to 0.6 million. The current ticket is generally the admission of a household, the amount is two households, it is the financial point of view with my main investment is in the docking. The third part is to actively connect with government functional departments and arrange to connect with the Finance Bureau Investment Promotion Bureau campus at least once a week to learn about the situation of enterprises in the region and obtain the list of high-quality enterprises. The branch cooperates with the level-4 credit insurance fund in terms of foreign trade loan, innovation loan, and growth loan. The branch cooperates with various administrative regions in terms of park insurance, and basically achieves full coverage of the region. The branch will preferentially select advanced manufacturing, green finance, and science and technology enterprises as the expansion targets and cultivate basic customers. At present, the branch has reserved 10 customers with an amount of RMB80 million. Fourthly, focus on quality core enterprises. Based on the provincial and municipal key project, Changzhou&aposs 532 action plan, and self-improvement implementation plan, focus on the agricultural industry leader dedicated to refined new double hundred enterprises flexible application online supply chain, expand high-quality core upstream and downstream, and achieve batch acquisition. The customer branch is located in Tianhe Solar Energy Cancer Hospital, with a distribution volume of more than 200 million yuan and a balance of 91 million yuan purchased from China International Steel, Tomorrow Chemical, Verley, and Bertrand. Chengdong construction has reached the on-line supply chain cooperation intention.
00:51:43
    Fifthly, we will explore professional market cooperation models, attach importance to building materials and agricultural trade in small commodity markets where customers are concentrated, and formulate appropriate financial service solutions through centralized visits to investigate business needs. At present, we have visited the Summer Flower Market, Lingjiatang Farmers Market, Evergreen, Changzhou Machinery, and Electromechanical City, and later, the marketing will be carried out gradually by point and area, mainly through the intervention of residential base station products, and the following will further study the professional characteristics. Develop special comprehensive service solutions to obtain customers in batches. Sixthly, we should establish a cooperation mechanism with external institutions, strengthen effective cooperation with government investment institutions, private equity institutions and other investment institutions, establish a long-term contact mechanism, and participate in various financing activities of science-based enterprises as early as possible through research and development of special products such as credit and innovation loans. At present, the branch maintains regular connection with Huatai Securities, Long Venture Capital, Hardware High-tech Investment Holdings, and People&aposs Investment Principal, relying on the advantages of external institutions to help customers expand. This actually deepens the business linkage mechanism. On the one hand, we can sort out high-quality retail customers, explore the enterprises behind individual customers, and find opportunities for Huawei&aposs business involvement. On the other hand, we encourage retail account managers to market standardized products, such as reception, to provide practice for retail customers. The branch also encourages all marketing staff to recommend the Company Department for preliminary customer review, and allocate customers meeting the basic access requirements to the Marketing Department to develop an allocation mechanism, so as to stimulate the enthusiasm of marketing staff.
00:53:12
    In the past two years, more than 30 customers, with an amount of more than 60 million, have been implemented through linkage, and the customer&aposs quality  is relatively good. The eighth is planting seeds is some of the advertising media input, right now is our Changzhou branch in Changzhou broadcast. Television building ads noon and evening. To the key product to receive the promotion, the branch will receive the electric ticket in the future, ensure that the key product is listed on the website of Changzhou Public Resource Trading Center for publicity, designated special interconnection, and responded to the customer&aposs requirements in the first time. Ninth, we will accelerate the implementation of Yinxin Property business, which is currently in progress. Currently, the branch is working with the Small Business Department to promote the cloud 10 products. Currently, the project is being reviewed by the HQ department and will focus on the process in the future. Speeding up some of this is a suggestion for the work of Inclusive business. Recently, the local competition for inclusive loans has entered a white-hot process, with banks loosening their policies on entry thresholds and price mortgage rates, and optimizing the timeliness of approval. The business opportunity is also fleeting, such as the local Jiangnan Bank, Jiangsu Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and other related banks for real estate business in three working days. We hope that Shangqiang will further optimize the approval mechanism and process of Inclusiveness business and improve the implementation efficiency of business.
00:54:42
    The second is to optimize the purchase management of reserves. We hope to resume the post-triggered purchase in the reception system as soon as possible. According to the current purchase management requirements, we need to check the new and existing loans on a monthly basis. Credit report collection, external query information, and collateral status must be reviewed manually. The branch has more than 200 main customers. Each customer needs to perform withholding once a quarter on average, which greatly increases the workload of customers. We hope to optimize the withholding operation. Hangzhou Branch will closely focus on the work requirements of the upper-level bank, with the spirit of achieving the mission, focus on multi-channel and more products, online and offline, and take the scale growth proportion and increase revenue as the orientation to achieve sustainable growth of service business. Cultivate a group of basic customers with branch development, thank you. How about training in the next few years? Governor Li, all leaders and colleagues, I will make a report on the work related to the inclusive finance of Nantong Branch in the first half of the year. In the first half of the year, the balance of inclusive finance loans in Nantong Branch was 1.099 billion yuan, which was 235 million yuan compared to the beginning of the year. The completion rate was 32.64%, so one of them was 113 million yuan, a net increase of 36 million yuan compared to the beginning of the year. And this is 20.3 percent complete.
00:56:07
    So the number of Inclusive Finance customers was 209, a net increase of 25 from the beginning of the year, and only 19.2% completed. In addition, compared with the 4 secondary branches, both in the number of customers and in the increment of 232,317, are in a backward position, and the overall completion situation is very ideal. I&aposm going to report that the vice president has also done some work in the first half of this year. The first one is in channel construction, and each one is vigorously promoting the supply chain Finance business. We have marketed a group of construction companies that are particularly worthy of investment, and at the same time, we have marketed supply chain Finance to our physical manufacturing customers. The second one is that we continue to increase our cooperation with this guarantee company. In the first half of the year, we increased our use rate by 8 percentage points. So the third is the private sector, which is also a breakthrough, because Nantong is now in this jumping area, and the development is slow, because this is some government control. Ah, we&aposre, uh, on this, and there&aposs still a second half of the year.
00:57:16
    The fourth one is to discover this platform, which is our work zone and campus security. The fifth team is to form the franchise team of Inclusive Finance, and the current team is to focus on the homestead belt business and gradually expand to the other business of Inclusive Finance. In the second aspect of corporate linkage, we are also required to sign this agency agreement when we open a new account. We are also actively marketing the agency business of our employees. At the same time, the executives of this company, the personal wealth, and the credit card business, and the customers of this personal homestead, we also actively market this enterprise to open this self-employed business, open this settlement account here, improve customer stickiness. In general, because the overall business is not particularly sufficient, so in this area, this one does not reflect its value.
00:58:21
    Third, in terms of comprehensive comprehensive income, the competitiveness of the unified market in Nantong is also fierce, and the overall income of our branch&aposs Inclusive Finance business has declined from now on. From the loan interest rate this year compared with the beginning of 15 bp, the current average interest rate is 4.33%. So, from this information, the interest rate on the inclusive loan of the state-owned bank in Nantong is basically within this 4%, and even with the manufacturing industry, the inclusive profit is already lower than the LP2 of the 21-year term. What about joint-stock banks? The interest rate of this universal loan of our bank is at a middle-upstream level, and we have made some comparisons with that of the local unit of Nantong. We have a small opinion on the price, personnel, and quantity of business.
00:59:28
    So, from this list, we can see that these five companies are in this list, and at this price, we don&apost have this advantage. We are also far behind in terms of personnel holding this organization. However, according to the business volume, the business volume in this table is not only Ping&aposan but also Suzhou. We only know that it is a company, but it does not have some personal business loans. Judging by the numbers, we&aposre, uh, relatively backward on this one.
01:00:09
    The second aspect is a problem in the current operation. First, from the perspective of June, the focus of our work led to the unsatisfactory development of business at the end of the half year. So from the first quarter, we should say that Nantong Branch is under great pressure in terms of operation. Therefore, after the first quarter, we think that the focus of work on this condition is uneven, such as the distribution, which leads to the development of the PW business, which is not happy.
01:00:52
    The second is that the stock has decreased. There are some objective reasons for the new laws. We added 90 million dollars in the first quarter. In June, there were 30 million dollars of 909,838 that were not renewed in time. Well, I think that&aposs what happens in every business. In terms of the expansion of new households, last year, of the business of our supply chain financial reserves in the fourth quarter were mainly concentrated in the construction industry, so because of the impact of the real estate market, entering the core enterprises have also encountered greater pressure in terms of credit approval. That also led to the delay of the original plan for inclusive reserves, and the amount of the reserves was significantly reduced, and the new situation was very passive. The third is that the inclusive channel construction is not enough. The first is that the in-depth cooperation with the guarantee company is not progressing significantly. So, what is the situation now? Nantong original guarantee company guarantees some customers, now each bank is robbing, now is cut off the guarantee company, the overall price because the guarantee company is inside, the guarantee company&aposs price is relatively higher than the general.
01:02:07
    Now, some of the silver companies in Nantong are unified, see the business of this area, and basically all the insurance companies have proposed. Therefore, we have been communicating with the insurance companies some time ago. They are also very worried. Their business is basically shrinking this year. The second is supply chain finance. We are still overly dependent on the construction industry, so the number of manufacturing customers in other industries is not high and relatively slow. The third is the homestead business, homestead business ah, the promotion is not strong, so the current is basically based on this part of the account manager, this individual this point-to-point marketing of the customer, did not play a supporting role. The fourth one is the inventory in the second half of the year. The amount in the past is also under pressure. At present, we still have 106 million dollars, which may be impossible to choose.
01:03:03
    So the third is the development advantage of inclusive finance in the second half of the year. Our goal for this year is to first make sure that the task assigned by Nanjing Branch is 720 million, not to make breakthroughs. This is the year we set ourselves at the beginning of the year. Witnessed to reach this 960 million. So the home base station to form an inclusive financial loan to 130 customers. So there are several measures, one is to broaden the channel construction, this is to open a new chapter in this batch of customers, and of course, the first is to further improve and bring a volume. So this is still to continue to deepen the cooperation with access to this guarantee company, increase the use rate of this guarantee company.
01:03:53
    Ah, our goal is to increase by another 6.75 percentage points by the end of the year. In this case, we will add another 150 million in the second half of the year. The main reason is that we are in the insurance and the comprehensive and far letter. The second one is to raise a ticket to a customer of a capabilities, then this one deepens the cooperation with this surety company&aposs patent agent business. At present, we have only one listed company in Hai&aposan, and we have invested 33 million, so in the second half of the year, we have at least one target of 50 million, which is mainly a wholly-owned subsidiary of our state-owned company. This is pure pure a trading company, ah this they have this with comprehensive guarantee, have this business cooperation, we have in this area already in the in-depth communication.
01:04:52
    The third is to promote the online supply chain finance in multiple industries. In the second half of the year, the construction industry, the high-end manufacturing industry, and the high-quality state-owned enterprises in the local industry chain will serve as the breakthrough point for this core customer, and deepen the real economy of Nantong region. Then we have also made a calculation. Our target for the second half of the year is also our reserve. We have achieved 250 million yuan of competition in the service financial sector through supply chain Financial. So far, there are eight customers. In order to get the first estimate to be 210 million, it depends on a higher court to approve a quota, so what&aposs the next step? We&aposll continue to strengthen the multi-sector supply chain finance, not just in the construction industry, but we have another advantage. We have also made efforts in our large equipment industry and large equipment.
01:05:51
    The fourth one is to open this, and it should be a new breakthrough in this collaboration. At present, we are also actively cooperating with the Science and Technology Bureau and the Finance Bureau. We are also actively cooperating with the Science and Technology Insurance Bureau of Nantong, and we are also actively cooperating with the Science and Technology Insurance Bureau of Nantong. We want to open up a new model that the bank and securities have just cooperated with. At present, we have reserves. Judging from our current reserves, we expect an increase of 50 million in this area in the second half of the year. So fifth, we must continue to build this destruction channel, and this homestead site is also a pain for us. So far, it&aposs more than a billion dollars in financial resources, and this year&aposs total increase is only 30 million. Therefore, in the next step, we should strengthen our efforts in this area, especially in the channel marketing area, to improve marketing efficiency and achieve success. We should actively connect with some third-party channels, including the mainland Golden Service and the common happiness.
01:07:05
    Second, we need to improve the productivity of the Inclusive Professional Team. We need to look for an opportunity to receive business through interconnection activities, centralized marketing interconnection in professional markets, and third-party coordination. The third is to strengthen this cross-marketing capabilities, ah, combined with the full transformation of the branch, to be a base for this physical customer, then we are also asking for a homestead belt on the street, ah, a lot of conditions, children are very small. Ah, so what about this one? I, uh, last week, because of our Changzhou branch and this Eric Xu, they also called, we are studying, learning. In terms of new goods expansion, the supply chain financial business we reserve in the fourth quarter of last year is mainly concentrated in this construction industry, so we should learn some good experience from this Changzhou branch as soon as possible, we should improve the marketing of a power.
01:08:05
    In the second half of the year, there are 20 million carriers on hand. In the future, we need to make sure that our competitiveness reaches 100 million this year. The second is to strengthen an internal appraisal mechanism. Then, we include the implementation and completion of Inclusive Finance into the year-end appraisal of account managers and department heads, and also through the Account Manager capabilities Improvement Contest. All efforts are made to enhance the awareness and creativity of the personnel of business line to serve small and micro enterprises. In terms of the allocation of financial resources, we have greatly increased the contribution of inclusive finance.
01:08:50
    The performance objectives of the department should be specified during the appraisal of the implementation process. So, from our current situation, this year is also a trial project. It may not be our project this year. Therefore, if the task of the department cannot be completed, we can only complete the Nanjing Branch and guarantee that our performance will be reduced by 30%.
01:09:19
    We&aposre finished. What&aposs it called? In this doubling plan, we get a 20% discount, and we get a 1 billion, so we get a 10% discount, and we get a 2 billion, and we give 1.1 times the reward, 1.1 times the reward, and 1.1 times the reward. We have already passed the publicity with the marketing department. And the fourth one, of course, we&aposll have some penalties for those who don&apost do well, and some policies that increase penalties, especially negative growth.
01:10:00
    Then the third is to strengthen the process management. Our branch has also set up a special promotion team to prepare for finance, and we have to report on the progress of the department&aposs inclusive finance work through the WeChat group. It is not limited to the progress of the data approval for customer marketing, channel construction, and so on. So, since Inclusive Finance, as the branch&aposs project to overcome difficulties, we now have to report this weekly in-house meeting, so we are looking for problems, measures, and paths. So the fourth one will make a brief summary. So what about Nantong Branch in the second half of the year is also a relatively clear path. The increase in reserves reached 550 million yuan. So, together with the first half of the year, we should reach 675 million yuan. At present, we have made sure that we have the data in our hands, which is 675 million. So there is still a certain gap between the annual target and the annual target. In this case, we will take the lead in studying the strategy and continuously strengthen the expansion management of inclusiveness.
01:11:17
    In addition to the above-mentioned special product reserve, we should also increase the marketing efforts of other channels to ensure the completion of the commercial bank&aposs task of 720 million yuan and strive to achieve the target of 960 million yuan set by the branch. Finally, I have a suggestion, because we have recently reported this inclusive project, especially in supply chain, and we have had a lot of exchanges recently, so Nantong Branch Nantong construction industry is still a traditional pillar industry. The annual output value is more than a trillion dollars, and despite the volatility of the real estate market and the exposure of the risk construction enterprises, there are still a lot of high-quality construction enterprises. We think that the risk controls of these high-quality enterprises are also stricter in risk, so we seem to look at the size of these assets, the output value, the debt ratio, and the proportion of these construction and real estate sectors. Ah this produced a number of sites, as well as cooperation with this real estate developers some of the list and so on, multi-dimensional this prudent search for this quality construction enterprise cooperation of the supply chain Financial business.
01:12:33
    We also discussed this issue at the ST meeting this morning. I think I would like to lead a team to Nanjing Branch to report the development of business in this area. So also hope is not hope, because Nantong Branch itself is also confident that capabilities can design and control this type of credit risk, we also hope to get the superior bank a full support. Okay, thank you. Ah, let&aposs ask the branch sales department to tell you at the meeting that I represent the central bank.
01:13:17
    Therefore, since the beginning of this year, we have not firmly focused on the consolidate product development foundation and the endogenous driving force of inclusive development. We have trained key as full-time employees, strengthened the marketing of all employees in the department, and improved the contribution of business maintenance. Facilitate the development of the company business. At the beginning of the year, the general manager&aposs office of the department formulated the customer management plan for the department. Inclusive Finance business requires key to focus on channel construction, and product selection is based on the guarantee of supply chain. In addition to assigning tasks to account managers on a special basis, the non-financial business targets for the whole year have been assigned to account managers at the beginning of the year. At the same time, the Inclusive Finance Account Manager is required, and the Inclusive Finance Client is required to do so. The company&aposs linkage includes sales of retail products of platinum cards, credit cards, funds, and insurance. The department emphasizes the analysis of marketing paths, effective control of marketing effectiveness, and firm implementation of channel methods, project promotion and customer focus.
01:14:15
    By the end of June 2022, the department&aposs inclusive finance balance was 390 million yuan and the number of households was 158, with the balance increasing by 145 million from the beginning of the year, 126% of the year, 63% of the annual plan, and a net increase of 43 households compared with the beginning of the year, 78.2% of the annual plan. Among them, the net increase in the balance was 89 million yuan, the net increase in the number of households 32, the completion of the annual plan 59%, basically achieved half of the time. This planning mission is irrelevant. In the course of the development of inclusive finance, the business department is focused on developing high-quality cooperation channels with the help of Wuhan Ethernet&aposs Continental Metal Promotion Bao products and conventional reception products. Based on standard products, control customer credit risk, business, risk, and account manager ethics risk, and promote the development of business.
01:15:08
    The first half of the project, which includes insurance sales and credit card issuance. Currently, the cooperation channels of the financial representatives we have contacted are basically about 40 effective channels. The second is asset treatment. At the beginning of this year, we provided convenient financing services for provincial government procurement supplier with the help of the Provincial Finance Department and the CSE platform. The current project is also in the process of transferring human systems, and the implementation of businessbusiness is being implemented. The follow-up key is mainly for business marketing promotion, the realization of modern batch customer acquisition. Conduct offline marketing for supplier in the area covered by our branch offices, and promote the development of business, including payment of salaries on behalf of agents, daily settlement and retail. Third, the campus insurance company business contacted, the provincial guarantee group&aposs subsidiary is a trustlist high-quality customer of the campus. Currently, the agreement has been signed, and the agreement is being connected to the campus network of Hukou District in Lishui District. The implementation of business will be implemented within the year. And finally achieved the goal to achieve bulk customer acquisition.
01:16:08
    The fourth commercial bank hospital business, then we based on last year&aposs loan renewal process of 30 enterprises 65 households in Shanghai, according to the development of business leases in the provincial insurance group subsidiary. A credit line of business, which protects the lease payment of RMB100 million, has been approved and is now being implemented in the company in business. We aim to complete the implementation of business by the end of July, because this lease may be a little different from ordinary manufacturing, so the intermediate process is a little more complicated. We hope to reach 50 million in equity investment by the end of the year to 424,669, which will effectively boost the growth of medium- and long-term manufacturing lending. Based on the development requirements of business and the actual needs of customers, we will increase the use quota of the developed products in the future. The fifth is the production and manufacturing enterprises of technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises. In the past year, we have also gone bankrupt. It is expected that at the end of the year, a number of such enterprises will be able to add at least 2030 million yuan of loans. However, this item business cannot and cannot be used as a strong subsidy for our inclusive enterprise due to the number of employees and the limitation of the number of employees capabilities, and may not be used as a subsidy for our future development.
01:17:26
    There are still many deficiencies in the development of business and business. In the next stage, we may do it from several aspects. One is that the development of department business is not comprehensive. In the first half of the year, the general loan of inclusive business is mainly based on finance. Including the business that drift loans have not broken through, and may be down today. The key product lacks application. Although the original warranty agreement has been signed, we must accelerate the interconnection of campus networks in the next phase to realize the normal development of business implementation. The second is that the company&aposs linkage has not really been implemented. In the first half of the year, the service business has had little effect in driving the development of retail business, of which only 300 credit cards have been issued and 12 cards have been issued. So what about the payroll for 67 households to realize 350,000 yuan of insurance sales. In general, the daily settlement of small and micro enterprise owners and the issuance of credit cards will be regarded as the joint marketing activities of the company in the future. In addition, for customers who pay in advance, the funds can be adapted through short-term products.
01:18:25
    Third, the stability of the business still needs to be strengthened. At present, the competition for the entire Inclusive business peer is fierce, especially our home mortgage loan, business, which is highly liquid, maintains stock and guarantees incremental growth, and continues to be achieved by diversifying our business enterprise products. Relying on homestead conventional loans alone cannot be satisfied. Then this policy in the park insurance industry modernization business, will also be our follow-up effective development of a key. Fourth, the use of trainee transactions is strengthened. At present, the development level of all account managers of the Sales Department is mixed, and overall it still needs to be strengthened. The operation and management plan formulated by the General Manager&aposs Office still needs to be put in place, and the process management is well determined to ensure the marketing path of each account manager. Realize all-employee inclusiveness.
01:19:11
    In this case, 2002 is a year for the development of inclusive finance. Inclusive finance will also be the top priority of the company&aposs transformation and development in the future. businesskey is not only about completing the annual plan, but also about expanding customer acquisition channels, stabilizing the stock and obtaining more interest, and realizing the long-term sustainable development of inclusive finance. Thank you. Good afternoon to Longjiang Sub-branch, which is also the first half of this year. The only possibility is that, President Li, all leaders and colleagues, good afternoon. On behalf of Linjiang Sub-branch, I would like to report on the current situation of this work. First, the completion of the first half of the year. By the end of June 2022, the loan balance of Longjiang Sub-branch was RMB 118.16 million, a decrease of RMB 26.24.67 million from the beginning of the year, and the completion of information technology was negative 27%.
01:20:04
    In the first half of the year, sub-branches distributed 34.3 million yuan to 14 households with house foundation, and 19.02 million yuan for firecrackers, firecrackers and electric tickets, and 1.7 million yuan for a bag of tickets. The small business loan was 5.2 million yuan for two families, 9.2 million yuan for the combined construction and 6 million yuan for Fu Feiting, and the total new loan was 74.09 million yuan. However, due to the homestead loan repayment of 3 million yuan, the small business loan was 13.45 million yuan due and the hospital was 70.07 million yuan due. The repayment of the vehicle insurance was 12.24 million yuan, a total decrease of 98.76 million yuan. Oh, this branch is not going to be finished. It&aposs going to be the bottom of the school. 2 there are major problems. In the first half of the year, the result of this result is that the branches do not have enough understanding of the importance of Inclusive business and do not have a deep understanding of Inclusive transformation. They still want to do simple things easily, achieve them overnight, and achieve immediate results. In the face of difficulties, there are insufficient methods, few methods, and insufficient resilience. Specifically, the following points are worth reflecting on.
01:21:09
    First, the path dependence is severe and the product channel is too single. The index of P&amp;W business relies too much on Huitong&aposs reverse factoring. One enterprise has one type of factoring (business). When the new annual credit line is not approved, the business declines seriously, and the other business cannot make up the gap. No suitable development model has yet been found for the second home base strip business, which is the basis of many inclusive business. At present, the branch still adopts the sporadic marketing mode of account managers. The channel construction has not been opened, and there is no stable and effective cooperation with the channel. This shows that the amount of 409,760 sporadic funds is small and the amount of 630,892 responsibilities is large. Compared with the beginning of the year, the number of new accounts is 33.23 million yuan. Completing the full year alone is 28 percent of this competitive target for the homestead belt. Three-piece hedging is mainly offline, with a single customer and poor stability. business is greatly affected by market price fluctuations, and the Pleasure Loan business does not make good use of the branch&aposs traditional business area for marketing, because the comprehensive income is insufficient. The company did not do well in linkage, and the pricing level was low. The implementation of the comprehensive financial service solution negotiated with the enterprise after the loan was issued was complicated.
01:22:24
    The third major point is the main work of the second half year. According to the current personnel situation, customer situation and operating characteristics, the branch has formulated several system plans for the organization work of the second half year. First, speed up the implementation of the industry business. At present, sub-branches have been approved for the industry business Huitong of 150 million yuan, Gimpo Garden of 10 million yuan, totaling 160 million yuan. Excluding the 9.2 million yuan already distributed, it is estimated that 130 million yuan will be distributed in the second half of the year. In the early stage, the credit period of enterprises is mainly three months, and the term is relatively short. Sub-branches should grasp the time and pace of issuance and control the scale at the end of the year. At the same time, they should focus on the audit of the authenticity of the trade background to ensure the safety and compliance of their intentions. 2. Strengthen the customer expansion and marketing of small enterprises. In the marketing, pay attention to manufacturing technology enterprises. In principle, they should have at least provincial, municipal and high-tech enterprise qualifications, have certain growth, have stable cash flow and mature upstream and downstream customers, and cooperate with the guarantor companies admitted by the Bank as much as possible. Or use our small business products to reduce the loan risk.
01:23:32
    At present, two customers with 15 million yuan have been approved, including 10 million yuan for Jiangsu Shengjiang Transport Co., Ltd. and 5 million yuan for Nanjing Gaoli Information Technology Co., Ltd. During the reporting process, there were two households with the amount of 1,400 yuan, namely, Nanjing Port Hui Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., 6 million yuan and Qin Dun Technology Co., Ltd., 2 million yuan. There are five customers for marketing and data collection. The total amount of the three types of customers above RMB21 million is RMB50 million. If 50% of the customers are obtained, it is estimated that the loan can be increased by RMB25 million. 3. Promote Alipay and e-commerce network business to win customers through multiple channels. The branch did 19.02 million yuan in the first half of the year business, simple procedures, good income. In the second half of the year, the branch takes advantage of this discount customer angle to recommend our rice cooker business to customers with Commerce business, and cooperates with enterprises with certain trademark customer groups. The branch will arrange special personnel to be responsible for the interconnection with the enterprise and timely contact with ticket-holder customers. Provide good services and try to improve customer experience. Try to add business e-ticket tubes in the second half of the year, with a balance of RMB 10 million.
01:24:44
    Fourth, look for high-quality residential customers, establish stable customer channels. First, to strengthen the research of the college, each public account manager and individual loan account manager must complete two home base belt, financial account manager strives to recommend a home base station, key in 6m1 million or more customers to sort out. Second, the branch must establish a stable channel for other customers, and strive to reach at least RMB business30 million in the second half of the year. Five upstream and downstream companies and subsidiaries of listed companies. Currently, there are seven listed companies and Suga. During the marketing process, the loan price required by the customer&aposs qualification number is very low, and it is difficult to crack the withdrawal requirement. However, we learned that some subsidiaries of the enterprise still have certain loan requirements. We also had preliminary communication about the overall cooperation solution, but the subsequent marketing did not keep up with it.
01:25:38
    In the second half of the year, key Marketing Promotion Science and Technology Department, Garden and other customers&apos subsidiaries strive to have 2 to 3 problems, with an amount of about RMB 20 million. Taken together, one store of a firm can complete 130 million yuan, one small business customer can complete 25 million yuan of electric casing 731,544, and one million yuan of electric casing 10 million yuan, another business can complete 30 million yuan, and a subsidiary of a listed company can complete 20 million yuan, a total of 215 million yuan. After making up the gap of 24.67 million yuan in the first half of the year, we will be able to complete the annual task of inclusive benefits issued by the branch. At the same time as business, we are looking forward to the sustainable development of business in the operation of 57089, which guarantees the credit of tech-based enterprises with risk next year. The development mode of the sub-branch and business and the direction of the sub-branch&aposs inclusive team construction are the issues that the sub-branch will continue to pay attention to and think about in the second half of the year. After the target path is determined, implementation is the key. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Bank, under the guidance of the branch department, and with the efforts of all staff of the branch, Longjiang Sub-branch will be able to complete the five business accounts in the second half of the year. Make sure that the end of the year is complete.
01:26:50
    The above is Longjiang Mayor&aposs report, inappropriateness please leadership colleagues to criticize and correct. You invite mayor jiangming. Dear Governor Li, all leaders and colleagues, according to the requirements of the branch on the spirit of the three-level meeting on inclusive finance, I would like to speak on behalf of Zhang Zhiqiang. The materials are as follows: My speech is divided into two parts, one is the analysis of the business situation and problems in the first half of the year, and the other is the economic development plan for the second half of the year. As of June 2022, the number of financial loan accounts of the Jiangxi Political and Legal Commission was 35, with a balance of 112.88 million yuan, and the number of additional accounts of the traffic police department was 10. The balance increased by 736 households, er, 1.36 million yuan, and the completion rate of the annual task indicators was only 8%. However, the proactive marketing of account managers is weak, and they do not establish a stable cooperation relationship with most of the customer channels. As a result, the customer exams are unstable, and the customer exams are snatched by other banks.
01:27:58
    Second, the regional roots are insufficient, the local resources are not fully utilized, and the customer channels that meet the local business characteristics are not well established. As a result, the regional market mix situation is worse than that of the large market, and the regional market share is low. Third, the management level needs to be improved, in the channel construction customers due to the performance appraisal risk control and other aspects of the new unit has a certain gap, the whole staff marketing awareness is insufficient, the daily behavior management of the marketing personnel needs to be further improved. Fourth, the learning and practice of the product system need to be further improved. We fail to make full use of the dominant products, and the utilization rate of the inclusive products in the active marketing customer market is low. The second part is the economic development plan for the second half of the year. In the first half of the year, family sub-branches will closely focus on the strategic deployment of the branch, fully complete the inclusive finance business target issued by the branch, and achieve a net increase of 180 million yuan in inclusive balance, of which the proportion of Kechuang maintenance manufacturing loans is not less than 10%. Realized a net increase in homestead loan balance of 120 million yuan, realized a net increase in bill loan balance of 0.5 million yuan, realized a net increase of supply chain financial balance of less than 0.3 million yuan. The specific work mainly revolves around the following four aspects: First, vigorously develop online and offline business, and steadily promote inclusive finance business.
01:29:07
    First, strengthen the expansion of high-quality home baseband cargo channels, make full use of the advantages of our medical home baseband and ordinary home baseband products, consolidate the exchange materials, and expand the marketing of customer channels. We have established 5 solid account channels. The current monthly order receiving volume is about 10 million yuan. It is expected to strengthen active marketing. The monthly order receiving volume is not less than 20 million yuan in the next month, and the balance of rights and liabilities is increased by 5.72 billion yuan. Second, based on the advantages of the regional industry, we have arranged core customers and prepared supply chain Financial business on site to achieve batch customers of shareholders&apos financial customers. Currently, we have prepared three supply chain financial customers. In the Jiangsu Mobile office project, the following three modes and confidences have been developed and two related businesss have been developed. After the implementation, the related 944429 processes have been streamlined, and they will be operated in batches. CCCC Southern has also exceeded the comprehensive credit line. After the HQ&aposs approval, CCCC has incorporated Huawei into its active banking system and carried out a specific cooperation in the following aspects:
01:30:12
    Third, we made great efforts to promote marketing and expand benefits to customers. We reached a business cooperation agreement with Sinosure, and established WeChat tools and WeChat workgroups. At present, the co-marketing project has been identified as the original committee member 50 million yuan, this week wednesday uh this above talks, at the same time it will continue to market female host to see the most headache project. The second part is to make full use of regional resource endowments, key marketing science and technology to create service customers. We are now conducting pilot projects around the layout of major industries in Jiangxi, because we are focusing on three major industries: smart grid, smart manufacturing, and energy conservation and environmental protection. Through the distribution of recommendation relationship marketing and inter-industry recommendation, we have realized that RMB5 million will be released to customers of the Green Energy category in the near future, and we have realized 48 customers of the Green Energy category, with a monthly payment amount of RMB550,000. For example, a total of 2 million yuan of wire connections has been achieved on the front line, which has accumulated some experience in marketing regional science and technology. In the second half of the year, the market will be based on the home science and technology market, further intensify marketing efforts, and promote the regional science and technology to promote the marketing of capabilities inclusive customers. Increase our regional market share.
01:31:20
    Third, actively promote the guarantee sheet business, er, won&apost win capabilities. Currently, due to the strategic cooperation agreement reached by the Innovation Department of the Provincial Credit Insurance Company, it is expected to conduct a project and receive business in the near future. After the project is implemented, it will sort out the related process business to realize the green channel process of the order business. It is estimated that less than $20 million will be invested in business by the end of the year. Reduced industrial and commercial guarantee has realized loan investment of RMB 7 million, project payment guarantee of RMB 5 million, prepared for this green energy customer loan project of RMB 10 million, follow-up business is in the middle of the year, and capital guarantee is actively negotiating the business cooperation model. Next, we will focus on the region&aposs high-tech parks and China&aposs comprehensive bonded zone high-tech enterprises to carry out joint marketing, and strive to achieve business cooperation of 20 million yuan by the end of the year. Fourth, strengthen the company&aposs linkage, improve the comprehensive return of inclusive customers capabilities. On the one hand, strengthen the sub-branch&aposs private customers and agent-issued customers, carefully sort out the marketing conforms to our bank&aposs data number of high-quality service customers. At present, we have distributed business customers on behalf of our customers and high-quality customers and professional customers, which can reach 5 million in the near future.
01:32:23
    On the other hand, we have gradually established our existing inclusive customers, strengthened our marketing interaction with financial managers, and strengthened our cooperation with customers. Improves the comprehensive return for Inclusive Finance customers capabilities. In the first half of the year, 102 payroll households have been re-borrowed by the company, with a total monthly loan amount of RMB 620,000. Jiangxi listed since the establishment of the shares business development has been our branch relatively weak a plate. In 2022, on the premise of achieving the target of business shares, business shares, we will enhance the financial marketing awareness of all employees of the branch, take root in regional markets, actively build and solid inclusive customer channels, and increase the regional inclusive financial market share. Uh, that&aposs the end of the statement. Okay. Finally, please invite Wu Xi&aposs mom and dad.
01:33:13
    Ah, Governor Li, all leaders, Wuxi Branch to report, first of all, the development of this non-financial business. In the first half of 2022, under the care and guidance of the upper-level bank, Wuxi Branch has clear objectives, in place the incentive mechanism, and set up an inclusive and professional team. Under the combination of multiple policies, the net increase of Inclusive business was RMB 333 million, making some progress over last year. The net increase is a 90% net increase for the whole of last year, but it is still some way off the semi-annual target. At the same time, competition for inclusive households and homesteads is relatively slow, and key needs to be pushed forward in the second half of the year. Then, the completion status of Jiangyin Sub-branch, the balance competition of Huihui loan and the competition of key products of Jiangyin Sub-branch in the first half of the year, and the balance account for more than 40% of the balance accounts of Puhui and the competition of key products in the branch. The contribution is relatively large. However, the competition of the homestead belt is relatively slow, and the marketing of the homestead belt needs to be further strengthened. The second is from the product structure, in the first half of the year, the credit insurance fund will not lend downwards, the guarantee company convenient loan, domestic letter of credit payment type business is relatively good, the increase from the beginning of the year is 99%, 163% and 97% respectively.
01:34:33
    Homeownership loans increased by 41 million votes, and one loan increased by 4 million, respectively, the completion rates were 23% and 4%, the gap compared with the target completion relatively large. Reverse factoring and general individual operating loans are negative growth, which is not ideal. The third is a case analysis of the local trade association business, so we also select five local trade associations for a comparison, namely, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Beijing, Suzhou, and Zheshang Bank. So from the balance of the first half of the year, our industry is third better than Suzhou, er, Beijing, Suzhou and Zhejiang merchants. However, in terms of the proportion of inclusive benefits, the data issued by this branch just now, the proportion of our bank is still the lowest. Therefore, the development of inclusive benefits business and the transformation of inclusive benefits business need to be further accelerated and strengthened.
01:35:25
    The second is the main problems and shortcomings. The first is that the scale is small and the proportion is relatively low. The trade union balance of our bank at the end of June was less than 1 billion yuan, the smallest among the four secondary branches, so it lags behind the local major urban commercial banks in terms of size and proportion. The branch will continue its efforts to increase the scale of inclusiveness as the development goal of key. Second, although this year, all business units and marketing departments have paid more attention to Pratt &amp; Whitney business, but business has a relatively poor foundation, lack of close cooperation channels and stable sources of customers, and the batch of customers has failed to form an effective path. Third, the application of the key product is insufficient. In this case, marketing departments are still used to cooperating with enterprises on government platforms. Therefore, they do not pay enough attention to physical and inclusive customers and do not have sufficient expansion efforts. Account managers still have a certain fear of difficulties and psychological burden when marketing entities. Fourth, in Q2, the branch designated a 5+3 full-time account manager team for the general meeting and formulated a brand-new inclusive business appraisal plan. However, the transformation of the professional team needs to be further strengthened and guided, and the results need to be tested and improved. The third part is the work objectives and measures for the second half of the year. In the second half of the year, the branch will make every effort to promote the development of Inclusive business through product drive, channel cooperation expansion, supporting mechanism optimization, and corporate linkage.
01:36:55
    Then the work measures of key mainly have several aspects, the first is to continue to enrich the inclusive business customer channels, forming a relatively stable circle of friends. The first is to build the customer channel of the home base road, increase the number of business sources in batches, and specify that the corporate department will take the lead in promoting the channel construction of branch achievements. Beginning in the first half of the year, the Corporate Department has gradually established account channels ranging from Jinfu, Xiaoju, Xiaofei, Maxin, and Fuzhou. In the next phase, the Inclusive Specialist of the Corporate Department will continue to take the lead and gradually improve the marketing mechanism. Complete initial work such as receiving orders, inquiry, and simple evaluation through WeChat group. The second is to have Wuxi branch business department and Jiangyin branch full-time account manager interconnection channel, regular visits and key marketing. Third, set up the homestead belt business special expenses, through special-fund-special-use marketing to promote the homestead belt channel construction. The second is to open up the channel for CITIC Insurance to obtain customers and increase the source of foreign exchange business. Then on June 20, we have held a business negotiation with the newly appointed head of CITIC Protection West Branch to clarify the direction of cooperation and the scope of customers. The Marketing Dept. 3 has also completed the preliminary connection with the business departments of CITIC Insurance, and has sorted out the 300 active foreign exchange customers of CITIC Insurance, so as to expand the inclusive foreign trade agent business of Wuxi Branch by obtaining customers in batches.
01:38:13
    Third, enter major campuses and expand stable cooperation channels. The branch has sorted out 15 campuses in Wuxi and determined that each marketing department will take root in one campus. By the end of the year, each department will have at least a marketing reserve park and 10 new households in the new district. The actual expansion will be achieved by 5 to 6 degrees. The fourth is to increase the number of customers through the guaranty company channel. By the end of June, 60 million of the 150 million guaranteed by the Credit Union had been used, or 40 percent. Wuxi co-financing guaranteed a guarantee line of $700 million, of which $105 million was used, or 15%. In the second half of the year, while continuing the marketing and cooperation with the cooperative guarantee company, the branch will add at least one guarantee company in Yixing area, and further expand and strengthen the convenient loan of business in Yixing area through the new guarantee channel. At the same time, you will increase the cooperation with the provincial re-guarantee Wuxi branch, on the basis of the cooperation in business Park Park Insurance business, expand a park insurance business in Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone. The second is the diversification of products, effectively increasing the comprehensive income of Inclusive business. First, in-depth study of the characteristics and industry characteristics of Pratt &amp; Whitney business products such as supply chain platform business of our bank, and improve the efficiency of Pratt &amp; Whitney business through the use of online platform products.
01:39:31
    First, the marketing has approved the project as soon as possible credit, at present, our bank has approved Dongzhu Ecology 70 million yuan, fund distribution 8000 trillion yuan, financing profit 3 million yuan and Wuxi Jiaojian 20 million yuan reverse factoring line. The second is to push forward the implementation of reserve projects, which are currently in the process of marketing for long-range cable, China building materials, and Volkswagen interconnection win-win years, and Jiangyin branch is promoting Xugong&aposs 100 million yuan CCC1, the 500 million yuan Jinqiao Chemical and Dajin Group&aposs supply chain financing projects. In the future, we will further contact the head office to discuss feasible financing solutions for the industry. Through the batching of supply chain, we will generate growth points for new Inclusive customers. The target for this year is to add 70 million new customers. The second is to break through the business of ticket-e-loan, with key state-owned enterprises as the target of key, to increase the marketing customers of ticket-e-loan business. Third, fully understand the pricing level of the market in Wuxi area, on the basis of conforming to the market pricing, the loan interest rate shall be determined in a bid to maximize the benefit of the Bank. Fourthly, we can improve the comprehensive income of the Bank by providing customers with account settlement, entrusted payment of wealth management, personal VIP services, and comprehensive financial services. The third is to seek breakthroughs in the proportion of key products to increase the number of customers based on the Inclusive Assessment Project.
01:40:50
    The first is to strengthen an assessment guide for the Marketing Department. Through the setting of PPI indicators, the quantitative assessment is carried out for the universal benefit key products, with a total score of 19 points. At the same time, a one-vote veto is implemented on the completion of the universal benefit finance. The second is to promote the convenient loan of key to business. In the second half of the year, the amount guaranteed by Jiangsu Credit Union is 150 million, and the amount guaranteed by Wuxi&aposs joint financing guarantee is 70 million, and we strive to use the amount to over 200 million. The fourth is the company linkage to expand the Wuxi branch of the business scale. The first is to pay attention to the prepayment situation of the case customers, for this kind of customers through our homestead products to conduct secondary marketing to obtain customers. The second is that the legal representative or individual shareholder of the inclusive customer requires to open a personal account in our Bank, so as to increase our VIP customer deposits, financial credit cards, etc. business. Individual Inclusive customers request to open a corporate account with us to increase the settlement volume of the account by business. Currently, 173 steps have been completed for the installed base. In the second half of the year, key will be added to the enterprise settlement account for the installed base of customers, and 35 individual VIP customers will be added for the installed base of customers. Streamline the boundaries between corporate customers and individual customers to enhance China&aposs contribution.
01:42:11
    So here&aposs a breakdown of the reserves of Inclusive Finance business in the second half of the year. The fifth is to further strengthen the construction of the full-time team. In April, the Bank completed the establishment of the full-time team of inclusive finance, and by the end of June, the initial results have been achieved. The two full-time inclusive account managers of Jiangyin Sub-branch and Business Department completed the inclusive competition of RMB 209 million. It accounts for 63% of the bank&aposs inclusive competition. Markets Division 2 has a total of 53 million, and 97% of the renewal progress has been made. However, in the second half of the year, the full-time account managers need to further strengthen their leadership. The first is to strengthen the management appraisal. In the second half of the year, the branch will strengthen the management and appraisal of the inclusive account managers, and further improve the inclusive capacity of the full-time and persistent inclusive account managers by linking the bill-to-bill system with the total resource allocation of the company&aposs sector and the preferential appraisal.
01:43:14
    Second, the corporate department promotes the construction of channels in the homestead belt of the guarantee company at the branch level. The full-time account manager connects to the channel, visits the key Marketing Company Department regularly, and implements strict process-based management. Finally, this is a work proposal related to this. At present, there are many online products of Wuxi Copper, which are developing rapidly, such as talent belt, science and technology belt, credit belt, etc., which plays a key role in the rapid increase of the total quantity of inclusive business of the Bank. Then we also suggest that we use a special online product from his bank in Jiangsu to help the development of Pratt &amp; Whitney business. For example, the credit reporting company of Wuxi City and the Bank of Ningbo have launched the business loan facility, which is mainly based on the credit reporting company of Wuxi City. A credit examination and approval model is established from 368 information items collected by tax, state power grid, gas company, market supervision, court, science and technology reserve fund center, and credit mode is adopted to grant loans to small and micro enterprises. Since it went online on October 28 last year, by the end of June this year, the number of easy-to-loan credit facilities had reached 5,200, and more than 1,900 had passed the credit approval, with a total credit facility of 1.07 billion. Of these, 1,149 have withdrawn.
01:44:33
    So Wuxi credit company has also developed this fire eye dynamic monitoring service system, and at present, there are banks such as Agricultural Bank of China, Pudong Development, Jiangsu, Ningbo and other banks connected to this system. Then on this basis, Wuxi Credit Reporting has also developed a credit collection product, and there are a number of banks that are negotiating this credit collection as a bulk acquisition platform for inclusive loans. The People&aposs Bank of China also regards this work as one of the requirements for each bank&aposs annual appraisal. Therefore, we hope to learn from this method and product in the future. Finally, the full-time staff of our bank are in place and the performance appraisal targets are clear. We are confident and determined to use our brains to find a path under the guidance and support of our superiors, make breakthroughs, overcome difficulties and resolutely achieve the annual target. Ah, this is Pratt &amp; Whitney business. Now, let me report the development of Jiangyin Branch in 2022. On January 16, 2022, Jiangyin Branch opened successfully with the support of Nanjing Branch, and President Li personally attended the opening and cooperation signing ceremony. Since its opening, Jiangyin Sub-branch has focused on the sustainable development requirements of Gao quality , taking the main line of increasing the operating income and value contribution as the main line, taking root in Jiangyin market, deepening customer operation, refining work measures, strengthening fine management, and striving to promote the healthy and rapid development of Jiangyin Sub-branch.
01:46:03
    Now we will report the development of the past six months as follows. The first one is to find the gap against the annual business target. This table is our main business target for Jiangyin Party this year. In the first half of the year, of the 17 key indicators in the company sector, 12 indicators achieved the semi-annual continuation, and five indicators failed to achieve the momentum. are bill financing transaction volume, manufacturing loan balance competition, Kechuang loan balance competition, foreign exchange business, and international settlement volume, respectively. The relatively good indicators are that the company has achieved or approached the annual target of opening new accounts in RMB, effective customer competition in RMB, mutual competition in cash management platforms, and green loan balance competition. In the retail sector of the eight indicators, two indicators reached the continuous progress, namely, the full number of customers and insurance sales, the rest did not reach the momentum, and the overall progress was slow. The second is to benchmark against peers to find gaps.
01:47:05
    We selected five local peers as benchmarking banks: Bank of Jiangsu, Bank of Nanjing, Bank of Zhejiang, Bank of Beijing and Bank of Suzhou. Bank of Jiangsu and Bank of Nanjing are our local banks, which are the largest in terms of the number of institutions, the number of employees, and the size of deposits and loans. They are also our benchmarks. We focus more on researching their local development key349876 policies and marketing dynamics. The earlier the opening time of Zhejiang Merchants Bank, Bank of Beijing, and Bank of Suzhou, among which Zhejiang Merchants Bank is a little earlier. So now, like us, they have only one branch, and the scale of business is relatively close, among which the deposit size of Zhejiang Merchants Bank is more than 480 million. Of this total, corporate deposits increased by $140 million and retail deposits increased by $340 million. In terms of loan scale, we are ahead for the time being, mainly for public loans. In this case, retail loans are just starting out. However, in terms of the deposit-to-loan ratio, we are the lowest, with only 71% of the gap. Therefore, this is the direction of our efforts. The third is to find gaps based on the contract signing targets. When we opened the business, we signed contracts with key enterprises of Jiangyin&aposs main government platform, and the intention to sign contracts at that time was $17.2 billion. At present, the total credit line of the Bank is 8.75 billion, the progress of the credit line is 51%, and the balance of credit used is 2.96 billion. Progress is 17%.
01:48:35
    The overall credit rate is low, but the credit rate is still low. In some cases, the Bank actively controls the operation scale, and in some cases, the credit grantor has no demand for funds temporarily or cannot use the funds temporarily. However, as a whole, further promotion of marketing is needed to improve the credit utilization rate. The fourth is the main work measures taken in the first half of the year. The first is to focus on the key project and customers. On the one hand, we attached importance to the cooperation with the local government and visited the Executive Deputy Mayor, the leaders of the Finance Bureau and the main organs. The leaders of the People&aposs Bank of China, the Banking Regulatory Bureau and the government&aposs main platform enterprises have consolidated and deepened the cooperation between banks and governments, and made breakthroughs in some of the key projects. Jiangyin City Investment invested 200 million yuan in loans to increase deposits of associated enterprises by 400 million yuan, Kangsheng Construction invested 100 million yuan to increase deposits by 120 million yuan, and Jiangyin Sub-branch made its first real estate development loan of 250 million yuan. For the subsequent development of public deposits and mortgages business laid a certain foundation. At the same time, there are a batch of unused government-type customer credit lines of 1.84 billion yuan, and the reserve on behalf of the government credit line of about 4.5 billion yuan.
01:49:44
    On the other hand, we accelerated the marketing expansion of local high-quality physical enterprises, proactively sorted and sorted out target customers according to the enterprise nature, industry status, special new sales and profit scale of listed companies, and added 11 credit customers of the entity category in the first half of the year, which has been approved. There are 7 unreleased entity enterprises with credit of 1.5 billion, and 7 reserve entity enterprises with credit of about 4 persons. The second is to focus on retail customers. First, the company&aposs linkage, by the branch team members to drive the marketing, link up with enterprise executives and other mid- and high-end training, and formulate comprehensive marketing plans based on customer requirements. As of the end of june, jiangyin branch am 300,000 more customers net increase 39, and withholding customers net increase 238. Second, external promotion. In the first half of the year, Jiangyin Sub-branch held various financial salons 6 times, outdoor promotion 10 times, using radio, television, newspapers and new media to release 11 times of advertisements, using residential elevator guardrails to release one centralized advertisement, driving personal large-value certificates of deposit sales of more than 30 million yuan and financial management of more than 2 million yuan. 1.5 million in insurance. Third, we should focus on team building. First, to speed up the recruitment of personnel, the branch conducted 12 interviews through Zhaolian recruitment, internal recommendation and other channels, and introduced 5 people.
01:50:57
    Second, strengthen personnel training, develop pre-job training for new employees, arrange face-to-face training, follow-up on-the-job learning, and self-study, and organize social recruits to carry out systematic learning. On the other hand, for the navigators to strictly implement the rotation of key posts, do a good job in the implementation of the rotation of the SIA personnel, strengthen the business management and the operation of risk supervision and control, and effectively prevent all kinds of errors. By the end of June, a total of three job rotations have been arranged. Third, the promotion of capabilities requires that new employees must obtain the qualification of the work certificate. By the end of June, four new employees have obtained the work certificate, and one on June 21 has not taken the examination of the work certificate. On the other hand, strengthen the talent reserve work, encourage and require service specialists and lobby managers to take the marketing qualification exams in batches, improve the qualification of the positions, and strive to build a team with multiple positions, one specialty, and more than one person. Fourthly, we should focus on internal management. First, the team members of Jiangyin Sub-branch attend the biweekly meetings of Wuxi Sub-branch. After the meetings, we will hold a problem-driven meeting to discuss and solve the problems encountered in actual work. Second, the president of Jiangyin Sub-branch is a member and the retail account manager of the company hold a meeting every day to clarify the development goals, summarize the work of the previous day, deploy the plan of the day, and supervise the progress of business.
01:52:18
    Third, the strict credit line risk, all the public credit line by the branch person in charge or the president in charge of the general on-the-spot investigation. As of the end of more than half a year, Jiangyin sub-branch financing balance of no future market balance credit assets quality  good. Fourthly, strengthen inspection and guidance, carry out multiple rounds of internal management publicity and conduct three flight inspections on important posts, so as to make employees better familiar with the rules and regulations of the Bank, strictly abide by the rules and regulations, conduct fire prevention, robbery prevention, and theft prevention drills on a quarterly basis, and keep records. Accept one on-site inspection by civil air defense and obtain safety protection. Fifth, build a strong anti-epidemic fort, in the May 4-18 epidemic period, arrange 5 key personnel to stay to start, ensure the continuity of business. The second is the main problem of Party building. The first is that the market share is small and needs to be further enlarged. The first is the overall low level, with a deposit share of 0.48% and a loan share of 0.83%. Second, the deposit share lags by 0.09% percentage points compared with the local bank. Zheshang Bank is 0.573%, which has not reached the overall share level of Wuxi Branch. Deposits are less than 0.03% and loans are less than 0.4%. The market share needs to be further improved.
01:53:35
    The second is that the customer base is not solid, and the degree of dependence on key customers is still relatively high. Both the company and the retail department are highly dependent on key customers, and an infectious customer structure has not been formed. The deposit accounts for nearly 50% of customers with an average daily deposit of more than 100 million, and the deposit accounts for nearly 30% of customers with an average daily deposit of 500 to 100 million. In terms of retail customers, AM accounts for 50.3 to 80 percent of customers with more than 8 million am customers, and customer profits account for 45%. The main reasons are as follows: On the one hand, the main energy is mainly spent on the marketing and maintenance of key accounts. On the other hand, the hierarchical management of customer groups is insufficient, the emphasis on and expansion of end customers is insufficient, and the presentation of basic courses and the application of products are not balanced. The third is to overcome the difficulties, the effect of the transformation of materialization is not obvious yet. Jiangyin area private economy development, this is also the Jiangyin market characteristics, although a few years ago some large groups and enterprises out of risk, but after this round of elimination, the remaining entity enterprises resist riskcapabilities significantly increased. Since the beginning of this year, the willingness to invest and the need for financing of real enterprises have declined due to the epidemic economy. As of the end of May, the total balance of manufacturing loans in Jiangyin was RMB 129.2 billion, an increase of RMB 5.073 billion over the beginning of the year, and the manufacturing loans accounted for about 34%. In this case, compared with the broad trading market, the manufacturing market of our Bank accounted for only 0.4%, and there is huge room for development.
01:55:09
    Although there were 11 new physical credit customers in the first half of the year, the progress of the implementation of 7 customers was still slow, leading to a lag in the completion rate of balance competition in the manufacturing industry, which was due to insufficient demand from existing physical customers. There&aposs also a reason why we don&apost have enough marketing. The percentage of manufacturing loans in the market is 4.63, but the percentage of manufacturing loans in Jiangyin has reached 34%, which is still quite large. The fourth is the slow development of retail business. First, compared with this year&aposs operating target, many indicators have not yet achieved the momentum of progress. Second, the onboarding progress of account managers is behind the plan. In the first five months, there was only one wealth management manager. In late June, there was a personal loan account manager, which also led to the start of the personal loan business. However, this effect started in mid-June, so the number of orders received in that month was 9.28 million, and the number of orders received at present has reached 13.49 million.
01:56:14
    Third, external marketing and corporate linkage are insufficient. Currently, the total number of individual customers is 411, and the number of am3m customers is over 300,000, accounting for 13%. There are only a few customers who proactively visit our outlets. How to effectively expand our customers and increase the number of mid-range and high-end customers is also a problem that we must address. The fifth one is capabilities to be improved, and the other is capabilities to be improved. Jiangyin Sub-branch has just been established for half a year, and there are many new employees. Most of the men lead the training phase, which leads to some gaps in the matching between some employees and the requirements of their positions. In the future, we will continue to implement the mentoring program, and the branch will strengthen the training and guidance to improve the profession capabilities to meet the needs of the position more quickly. Second, the work efficiency needs to be improved. Teams are in the run-in and integration period. Some time segments business affect the work effectiveness. In the future, we will further optimize the position configuration, strengthen the business plan, and improve the work efficiency based on the overall situation of business. The third is the work objectives and measures for the second half of the year. The first is the overall business objectives. First, benchmarking with advanced peers, increasing market share, keeping a close eye on peers and benchmarking with Zheshang Bank. By the end of the year, the deposit balance will be stable at 2.8 billion, an increase of 328 million over the first half of the year. We will strive to reach as much as 3 billion yuan, with the loan balance exceeding 4 billion yuan, an increase of 550 million yuan over the first half of the year.
01:57:38
    The local market share reached 0.5% and 0.9% respectively, further enhancing its influence in the local market. The second is to achieve the annual plan for the main business indicators, especially the increase in customer deposit and loan revenue and the four major financial indicators, so as to strive to exceed the task and increase the contribution to the branch. Third, in terms of personnel, on the one hand, we continue to introduce talent and form a stable team of about 18 people. At present, we have 16 people, including five corporate account managers and three retail account managers, and one of them is inclusive. So the proportion of marketers is more than 65%. On the other hand, speed up the running-in of existing personnel and the integration of teams, strengthen the important and continuous improvement of the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the sub-branch through the training and integration of business. The fourth one is to ensure safe operation. The second is concrete work measures, one is in the company business to do deep government customers to strengthen entity enterprises. One is to deepen all aspects of the government, although the current business of the government category is a general control situation, but as a newly opened sub-branch, Jiangyin Branch will be a new market, there is a broad development space, so it also hopes to be able to obtain the strong support of the superior bank.
01:58:54
    Since last year, Jiangyin has invested heavily in urban renewal, old city renovation, industrial park renovation, science and technology park construction, and urban road construction. The total investment in the next three years is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan. Among the local banks, banks such as workers and peasants intermediaries, Jiangsu and Nanjing have made efforts in urban renewal, old city renovation and industrial park renovation. Nanjing Bank of China Construction Bank, through urban renewal loans, achieved deposit deposits of 1 billion yuan in the first half of the year. Bohai Bank launched $190 million in urban renewal at the end of June, which also effectively boosted deposit growth. So Jiangyin sub-branch wants to achieve the rapid growth of the scale of deposit and loan, it is an inevitable trend to strengthen cooperation in the government&aposs business aspect. First, the credit line in the policy of a batch of expenses has been implemented quickly. On July 8, Jiangyin East has the first ultra-short-term financing of RMB 400 million. It is estimated that the first urban renewal project in Panxiang will be implemented this month, with a deposit of over RMB 300 million. For the credit line of other expenses, we should also strengthen marketing or adjust the operation direction, and timely launch. Second, speed up the project reserve. At present, Jiangyin Sub-branch reserves about 5.2 billion government loans, underwriting and investment credit lines, and we will strive to submit them for approval in the third quarter.
02:00:12
    Third, to expand the circle of friends, speed up off-balance sheet and matchmaking business marketing. Currently, the 3 billion guaranteed financing plan is in reserve, and the 900 million euro foreign debt business trust project is also following up. Medium-term bills, financial direct financing, and other effective categories of business are also stepping up marketing efforts to strive for the implementation of projects within the year. Then in the deposit aspect actively marketing Jiangyin City grade, as well as Lingang high-tech zone and other financial bureaus and other ministries and commissions to follow up the bidding and bidding pilot, for the implementation of financial deposits. Therefore, the financial deposits of Jiangyin City will adopt the form of tendering from 2021, and the tendering meeting for incremental financial deposits has not been held since the beginning of this year due to the combination of factors such as economic downturn, epidemic tax rebate and other factors, so the Bank will strengthen communication and follow up closely. At the same time actively marketing Renheng Real Estate&aposs fund supervision account, strive to achieve a regulatory fund in the fourth quarter. The second is to strengthen the entity enterprises, the first is to strengthen the cooperation with the Bureau of Industry and Information Technology, National Development and Reform Commission, taxation, investment promotion, environmental protection and other townships, and to enrich the entity enterprises&apos channels for obtaining customers. Second, to strengthen cooperation with Jiangyin peers, in the manufacturing industry bank loans, new customer referrals and other aspects to increase various channels. Third, strengthen the cooperation with CITIC Insurance, through CITIC Insurance first-class to expand Jiangyin area high-quality physical customers.
02:01:34
    The fourth is to accelerate the implementation of projects to be approved, strengthen the marketing reserve of target customers, especially in the manufacturing industry green and science-based customers, strengthen public relations efforts, and strive to achieve effective investment of no less than 200 million in the third quarter. For the current reserves of 14 target customers (about 1.47 billion), make a marketing plan for one customer, and try to initiate credit granting processes for 4 to 5 of them in the third quarter. No, no, no, no? In the case of Inclusive business, by the end of June, the balance of Inclusive loans of Jiangyin Sub-branch was 342 million, accounting for 10% of Inclusive loans, an increase of 158 million from the beginning of the year, exceeding the progress of the first half of the year. However, there are still problems of weak follow-up growth and single means. In the second half of the year, we will further expand the scale of five businesss from the following aspects: First, platform-based marketing is being promoted at present. Xugong&aposs financing project of supply chain.2 billion yuan in Jiangjiangxi and Jingbapiao areas, the project of supply chain from China Trading, and the project of supply chain from Jinqiao Chemical Group are under negotiation. In this case, we should strive to report the financing credit line of business for one or two households in the third quarter, and strive to implement the platform for at least one household within the year.
02:02:53
    Second, the marketing of core products. Jiangyin Sub-branch will strengthen the marketing of foreign trade enterprises of small and micro entities by utilizing our superior products such as inclusive loans, foreign trade loans, and homestead loans, and expand business through superior products. The third is to strengthen cooperation with Jiangyin Credit Union guarantee agencies. The fourth is to strengthen the cooperation with Jiangyin key townships. At present, there are Huashi, Xinqiaosuke, Tang Minting, Yuecheng, etc., who have not cooperated, will strive for full marketing coverage, business will be implemented. The fifth is to strengthen the cooperation with the park, through product promotion meetings, customer societal to realize the park inclusive business marketing. Sixthly, the establishment of full-time account managers, Jiangyin branch has been equipped with a full-time account manager dedicated to inclusive benefits, formulated an assessment plan, to fully market inclusive benefits business. The target customers of Inclusive Finance are as follows, and the second one is in retail business, which is to make big loans business and do deep wealth management. The first is to define the target and develop key, develop the plan and implement measures for the retail PPI, effectively carry out the marketing work, establish a reasonable performance distribution mechanism, strengthen the company&aposs linkage, and carry out all-employee marketing.
02:04:07
    The second is to visit target customers effectively, proactively go out of the outlets, carry out the main unit, enter the community, enter the vegetable market less work, formulate the outward expansion plan, and actively go on marketing. In the second half of 2022, Jiangyin Sub-branch will continue to carry out outreach and street-sweeping activities in surrounding communities, vegetable farms and business circles, consolidate the achievements of already entered communities and vegetable farms, expand the scope, and carry out project activities in an orderly manner for non-entered community units. In the second half of the year, it is planned to carry out activities such as entering the community, vegetable market and shopping mall once a week. At the same time, it is planned to carry out theme negotiation activities with developers, insurance companies, securities firms, and fund companies. It is planned to carry out no less than five meetings. By asking customers about the salon objectives, the basic customer base will be expanded to 300. Deposit finance sales of 50 million, insurance sales of 1 million, then this is a marketing goal and progress. The second is to accelerate the development of mortgage business. In June, through more than half a month&aposs efforts, the first mortgage placement and the total collection exceeded 10 million. However, there is a long way to go against the development goals and requirements of the whole year.
02:05:18
    Then July and August is also a desalination, is also an off-season to buy a house, then we strive to achieve by the end of the third quarter to achieve a total of more than 50 million, the amount of more than 40 million. First, continue to strengthen cooperation with intermediaries, fully expand second-hand housing mortgage. At present, all mortgage receipts of Jiangyin Sub-branch come from second-hand housing intermediaries, so now there are 14 receiving orders, in addition to Guoguang Real Estate, mainly local small intermediaries. Follow-up will be marketing, Panjiang marketing, Hunan New City and other local chain intermediary cooperation, continue to consolidate and deepen channel cooperation. Second, to strengthen cooperation with developers, has been prepared to declare a property is in the process of 1 property reserve declaration access to the property, 1 this camp sales of 5 properties. The fourth one is to strengthen the development of business. Jiangyin Sub-branch achieved 238 sub-branch competition in the first half of the year, with a target completion rate of 43%. In the next phase, we will continue to strengthen the company&aposs linkage, identify the target customers of agency delivery, gradually develop the marketing plan, and focus on the process management. At present, 550 customers have been allocated with the delivery of business customers to strengthen the base customer base of 672,900 retail customers. Finally, the related, uh, job advice. The first is to strengthen the support for the local government. The government investment in Jiangyin in the next three years is relatively large, and local banks are increasing cooperation with government customers, especially in urban renewal, industrial park reconstruction, and old city reconstruction. Therefore, the duration of such projects is generally long. Competition in the industry is also intense, so we hope that the branch will be able to meet the business policy deadline.
02:06:57
    Price and other aspects to give strong support, then Jiangyin city government also very much value each bank in this respect input and support strength. The second is support for the traditional manufacturing industry in Jiangyin, where the real economy of Jiangyin is developed, but the traditional structure is relatively traditional, such as textiles, steel and shipbuilding. Currently, the top tax-paying groups are basically concentrated in these three industries. Then it is also the Jiangyin region of the banks manufacturing financing investment accounted for a relatively large three industries. Then in this area also hope that the strong Jiangyin sub-branch reported high-quality traditional manufacturing support. Third, in terms of operation guarantee, Jiangyin Sub-branch, as the first county-level sub-branch under the jurisdiction of Nanjing Branch, received strong support from various departments of Nanjing Branch during its opening, and I would like to thank you for the operation of risk retail and other systems after commissioning. At present, it is also basically running normally, and has laid a good foundation for the smooth operation of Jiaxing Branch. At present, there is still a small problem, that is, the credit risk management system. Jiangyin Branch still has the structure setup problem. Then the risk department of Nanjing Branch has also helped us to communicate with the head office for several rounds. The answer of the head office is that the system was not considered to set level-1 sub-branches under the level-2 branch, which cannot be solved at present, but needs to be reformed and developed to realize it.
02:08:28
    At present, Jiangyin branch initiates credit line business, still needs to be operated through the original Jiangyin marketing department, so this also gives us the data statistics and business processing brings some inconvenience. In consideration of the future, other secondary branches will also be set up and sub-branches will be set up. In order to streamline the process, it is also suggested that the head office can complete the reconstruction and development of the system as soon as possible. Ah, that&aposs my report. I&aposm going to criticize and correct the inappropriateness. Ah just now this refueling sub-branch should have done a very good Wuxi office, ah to this Jiangyin investigation made a very detailed analysis, ah should fully affirm, ah should say did a lot of work. Should the household branch is the first credit branch of Nanjing Branch, why do we need special topics today? It&aposs almost half a year today. Please do some introduction to Wuxi Branch and give us a little inspiration to the other three secondary branches of Qijia.
02:09:31
    Let&aposs take a look at the current Jiangyin branch. Didn&apost you? Reached us. Well, for every secondary branch, we want to set up the original vision of the county branch. Generally speaking, we think Nanjing Branch has developed to today, in the construction of the team and the construction of the network to do a reasonable addition.
02:10:05
    Ah, I think at this stage, it is also President Zhu CCB of the head office that has been asking Nanjing Branch to do some serious thinking, ah, in fact, including the development of Pratt &amp; Whitney business, ah, when President Zhu called me on June 30. In fact, he has also obtained the development of Pratt &amp; Whitney business. It is purely online and always feels that there are hidden worries. However, depending on the phenomenon, do we have such competition capabilities? Yes.
02:10:36
    Reasonable customer&aposs 48530, one that we need to think about, ah, so I think ah and your car is imperative, but for each of our industries, The bigger and harder task is the next step after 10 branches. My personal opinion is that the first objective is that you may compare with the original three-year plan and with the county-level branches of the same kind in Suzhou.
02:11:17
    Is it feasible? But I remember that last year, the average daily deposit of Jiangyin branch was about 21. This year, we set a target of 2.2 billion for ourselves. In the first half of the year, I don&apost think this target is a deployment feature. Ah, second, I hope our benchmarking, ah, our benchmarking is a conversion, ah, in fact, Director Jiang was prepared to consider the Zheshang Bank at the beginning, but what should we consider? What is the credit policy of Zheshang Bank? In Wuxi area, ah in Jiangyin area, because Zheshang Bank adopted the loan pricing model is the highest, resulting in Jiangyin area government platform projects, there are a lot of red above.
02:12:09
    Actually, our Bank of Shanghai should be aligned with a comparable target if Zheshang Bank selects a good target for benchmarking. I think this aspect may also need to do some serious thinking. Because the head office, according to the idea of the head office chairman, still wants Nanjing Branch to strengthen the shipment of county sub-branches, and some reasonable control of county sub-branches. Perhaps the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the indicators of Jiangyin branch may also have to look back and look again.
02:12:57
    Ah, the third one you mentioned just now is about the support of the government branch. Ah, I said that we cannot support the Jiangyin government, but what is the general strategy? The general support, but there is pressure, ah, we this this, we also unified our thinking last week, including our Changchun overall tone reflected Jiangyin all stop. Well, what we&aposre going to guarantee is new urban renewal, infrastructure, new projects, and we&aposre open to full support.
02:13:40
    Well, of course, including some of our new business, which is also fully supported. Ah, but under the current background, ah I think reasonable control ah hidden ah ah ah for Jiangyin Bank, ah now is really not, so this I also with Wuxi solution ah may do some brief talk about our next step, of course specific case we can discuss again. Here&aposs what you&aposve just given to our branches, four branches, three secondary branches, and maybe some of the suggestions you might be able to answer today.
02:14:18
    Ah, I personally look, Changchun branch more about the efficiency of approval, this Nantong branch talk about the construction industry approval differentiation. Wuxi Branch made two suggestions. One is the innovation of online products, such as easy things and easy loan products. How do we feel the Small Business Department respond to this, and then another is the support of Jiangyin Branch&aposs systems, including the credit system. Ah, this is probably risk.
02:14:59
    I hope we can respond today, so we can respond today, and we can do it another day as the people you will. Well, just briefly, just to respond to the question that was raised by the two branches. The one related to our approval is the construction industry, which is because the head office sets the policy, but from the point of view of our approval, especially the Nantong Branch of Nanjing Branch, which is the characteristics of such an industry. We&aposre looking at our audit department&aposs determination of the industry with a substantial credit of risk. Judgment.
02:15:43
    So it&aposs true that the construction industry is facing a bit more of a possible relevance. It&aposs in this big real estate market, right now? There may be another one in the second half of the year, and there may be another one in the second half of the year. It does require us to sit down together. Discuss how to do this business, including how to get our risk control points and how to lay out the risk control points, so I I very much welcome the suggestion that Nantong Branch put forward just now, that is, let&aposs have a special discussion, we can make adjustments with the company when the time comes. We&aposre working on this product together. No. What I think can be done at the moment is that the key is the solution. This is a 95-year-old one for manual customers.
02:16:27
    What&aposs more, we have a lot of cooperation with the small treasury today about the current product design situation and the product aspect. We also very eagerly hope that the on-site business can be produced in a certain amount, because it is indeed manually approved offline. capabilities, which also responds to the actual efficiency issue that we just mentioned. At that time, I looked at the approval of our first half of the year, which is the home base station. Actually, the home base station is now very standardized. Since the opinion of the head office was transferred out, we are basically the same as the standard on the line. In the first half of the year, we approved a total of 453 applications, which is 40 more than the same period last year. In this case, about 30% of the applications are online products.
02:17:13
    There are two types of approvals in Tibet, one is three, and the total amount is about 3032 billion. About 15% of them, and about 46 of them are up-filed, so judging from this ratio, it&aposs actually much better than last year. This is because last year, on the one hand, efficiency was standardized, and on the other hand, it was true that the period of withdrawal from the Party was relatively long, and the quantity of withdrawals was relatively large. At the time I was under the impression that at least 70 or 80 percent needed to be repaired, so this had a bigger impact on the time limit. After the standardization of an approval standard for our offline rectification, and this special interview with you, I think everyone feels that the application of the product, including the quality , has been greatly improved. So this year, I think it will be better for him in the future.
02:18:07
    Then some projects may have risk increase in business. What about the risk dispute? I&aposve always been talking about riskrisk. There are some problems in the standard, even if we take it out for discussion, I think it&aposs not a problem. So what we&aposve said many times with the coffers, right? If there&aposs a problem, we talk face to face, and I hope that we can come to a conclusion about this case, and I hope that we can come to a conclusion, so, so, so, so, I&aposm going to say from my feelings about this approval of Pratt &amp; Whitney Port in the first half of the year. Unlike last year, when we reached the end of the month and the end of the quarter, I think the scope of approval is larger than before. We should have completed an approval task given by the branch earlier.
02:18:49
    At the same time, this year, we have added an inclusive review qualification to retail reviewers. It should be said that our reviewer strength has also grown, so I&aposm quite confident. Just now, we talked about a lot of launch plans in the second half of the year. I hope we can make a plan and make a good support for the SP. Toyota won&apost return. Wuxi branch just mentioned this, uh, one of the GMS credit system is this, we are a small class, because the head office. At the time of the system design.
02:19:30
    There are not so many levels of this line, so now it does not exist in the system, that is, the level of sub-branches can be set under the level-2 branch. In the early stage, we also communicated with the management of risk about the risk management department of the head office. At the same time, we are trying to figure out how to streamline the business process under the existing system module. So tried, it is the current temporary it can only be um people stay in the Wuxi branch of the Jiangyin marketing department under to initiate. In this case, this method is a temporary one-by-one processing method. In addition, if the county sub-branch of our bank is to be carried out in the future, it is not very convenient for statistics and business, and it is not conducive to efficiency. Then communicate with the head office in the early stage. The head office means that if this level is to be set, it needs to be reformed. In the future, we will also increase communication with the head office. We hope that the peers can help us implement this system as soon as possible.
02:20:49
    Overall, it&aposs difficult to transform. Well, why is it now? It may have to change the entire system level, and it may have to be changed. He didn&apost. There is another kind of him if now hang under the name of Nanjing, there is still a chance. Okay, think about it. The small business just mentioned this cooperation model in Wuxi. In fact, the president is also negotiating with us recently. What is the main point? The head office has launched a new version of the new generation is the original tax loan, this is the silver and tax cooperation of this product.
02:21:42
    It turned out that we had the last one, and now it&aposs after iteration, and then it should be the first two quarters, and then the head office issued a zero-tax zero-tax project to the IT department of the relevant departments of each branch. I think we&aposre done. Testing. After the transformation, our new credit loan is a product that is not a traditional one, but is just a silver tax, based on a product such as Tax data, which will have, but it has an open system. The subsequent credit loan is based on the tax big data, which can be stacked on the basis of other transactions data or third-party data. That is, our head office is in June or July. It will be signed by Shanghai this month, and then we will try with the head office anyway, or will try with us at the end of July, except that we are talking about the traditional model based on the tax figure of data. It is also possible to superimpose such a product based on the specific data, so Wuxi put forward a requirement, and we can communicate now, that is, the product design will be carried out at the end of the month, and we can consider introducing such a cooperation with Credit Reporting. Because Suzhou&aposs credit investigation is the earliest and most mature one in Jiangsu. In fact, when we discussed last time, he also raised such a requirement. So this may be the same as this requirement in Suzhou.
02:23:22
    Then this can be written down for us. Okay, finally, the president in charge. Ah, workman. Right? According to President Lee, strong inclusive finance is going to be sustainable. Sustainability goals, uh, risk, controllable. I think I just -- I think I&aposm going to be very brief about this question and this job requirement.
02:23:53
    The first one is 500 million, the question of real and fake universal benefits. Today is an internal meeting, this is the so-called low-level government customer business, this site is still relatively high, ah small treasury statistics, I do not know the semi-annual data, the previous statistics at the end of the first quarter, the statistics of the whole bank is close to 40%. Yeah, one-third or more, right? There are a few operating units that are nearly half of them. I think if we say that business is too much, then let&aposs talk about sustainable development, or let&aposs analyze the structure of business, which is also a big discount in the future.
02:24:40
    So I think we need to raise awareness about this issue, even if these so-called third-tier, government customers are guaranteed by a guaranty company. Ah, so we have business management departments and audit departments to keep a close eye on this. Now the small treasury has a set of such control solutions, so we hope that this can be continuously promoted, right? To be able to adjust the structure, that&aposs the first problem.
02:25:21
    The second is the problem of our inclusive finance operation risk. The risk operation risk of Xinjiang inclusive finance business is relatively large. We have already experienced this in practice, and the prestige, including the authenticity of this subject, including his data. There&aposs no fraud on these, because we&aposre in some of the most recent business out of risk, we&aposre going backtracking, right? Well, having discovered these problems, it&aposs possible that we&aposll lose the lawsuit in the course of the lawsuit.
02:26:04
    There&aposs no way you&aposre paying normally without these problems, but we just didn&apost find out further, right? This is a statement and it exists. It&aposs borrower compliance, the second direct-use compliance, right? Then we do post-loan inspection management, ah at least in our bank or I in our control, you this entrusted payment is good, right? If you use your money, or check it on your behalf, he must comply with our rules.
02:26:41
    So when it comes to getting the mortgage registration, ah, because you&aposre in a standard mortgage together, everybody thinks this treasure is all over this house, right? Even if you have some other flaws, if the mortgage on the house is blocked, the mortgage is also massaged, ah, the overall problem is not that big. Now it may be in practice that there is no way to think that translucency is actually possible.
02:27:22
    That&aposs the marital status that was mentioned in the vault, right? It&aposs called a personal guaranty, which means that both spouses bring a person, ah he&aposs he&aposs a fake divorce, right? No, I don&apost know. Chongqing. So what&aposs in it, I&aposm just reminding you, we&aposre talking about getting to know your customers, right? You must know your customers and know your business when you are in the approval process.
02:27:52
    Second, it&aposs important to understand your employees, and it&aposs important to manage their behavior. In these business some batch of business, is generally not able to alarm your branch president, or in the small role of your business, right? You said that the big business is your branch president personally in the marketing, analysis, and solution development, such as Inclusive, especially the standardized, basic account managers in the handling.
02:28:26
    So these are the situations you need to know and pay attention to your employees. Ah, this account manager is the key position, we earlier this several related departments ah ah ah ah a microblog, discipline inspection room, right? And the coffers have also joined forces to do some of this employee behavior. We&aposre doing some of these letters, client business, right? Even it is a kind of control and a kind of reminder.
02:28:57
    Ah, I think the problem of this operation risk must not be sloppy, you this quantity once up, so risk caused significant, also relatively clear. The third problem is the credit risk of Pratt &amp; Whitney business. The credit risk still exists. In the first half of the year, we have now looked at data, and now we have entered 10 orders of business. The amount is about 40 million to 30 million.
02:29:46
    It&aposs a common climate for individuals to be together. In addition, there is overdue interest, and that request, my credit risk or there. Of course, it&aposs not that we want to go after zero risk, but what about PFC business because of the current epidemic, and the impact is still going on, right? It&aposs true that there are some trades, restaurants, and this tour, right? In fact, this includes some of its related industries, and it will be affected, directly affected.
02:30:25
    Then the other thing is this online business, because of the use of his funds, we can&apost fully control it, so its real use, if he uses it to invest, use it to other things that go wrong, then it will also generate credit analysis. In addition to the compliance issues we just talked about, it&aposs actually translated into systems analysis. This credit risk is to be wary of.
02:30:59
    In fact, this morning, we attended the meeting of the Executive Office of the Head Office, and we were analyzing it. We said that the retail level was business, the retail level was business, and the retail level of business and risk in the first half of the year was expected to be better than at the beginning of the year. We may think that this situation will be worse at the beginning of the year, but we have not found that the implementation of this half-yearly situation is OK. What is the reason? The most direct reason is that there is a lot of construction online, such as borrowing, right? The loan business is said to be fully settled by July, so what does that mean? It&aposs an objective situation. Of course, when we designed the business, we also had a high yield of risk, but its performance was risk, right? It&aposs some data, bad rate, and reality, these data will reflect.
02:31:52
    That is, the line business high risk is an objective situation, it is not transparent. Ah, then the offline business may be compared to you to do your best to check, then the amount is relatively large, right? Even if the attention may be greater, all aspects of the appropriate control. So what I&aposm saying is, the whole credit risk feature, ah, the second line is let&aposs talk about inclusiveness, right? Although we have some measures to resolve it, but he is actually risk is relatively large.
02:32:34
    The fourth one is actually a requirement for our management department and audit department. Insurance is our approval department. Mr. Guo also introduced it just now. We have done some work and are continuously improving the mechanism and process. In this order of business, we are preferentially inclusive and preferentially inclusive. We set a standard at that time, inclusive first, retail first, right? And the approver is now called Jiangang, right? Supervision is to batch retail, also to batch map, also to learn to batch map.
02:33:15
    So this objectively means that the number of inclusive benefits increases, and, of course, the public must be more important, must be. Right? Even when Pratt &amp; Whitney is busy, the company can also approve the retail IP address. Therefore, I think the personnel can be guaranteed. Of course, if it&aposs more demanding, right? From the long-term goal of digital approval, there is still a gap.
02:33:44
    In this way, the HQ will further improve the system, including the follow-up of the whole process. Ah, I think this piece is a hint. So in general, I think that the head office has just studied and worked out a method for inclusive finance. How can I implement it? The regulatory department&aposs suggestion that we dare to lead the hospital and can lead the hospital is that we should analyze these eight words. It&aposs not easy to really implement or do well.
02:34:19
    Ah, let&aposs take a look at ourselves now, and we&aposre willing to take it, right? I&aposm afraid there is still a big gap in many respects as to how far we can achieve it. Well, there&aposs an extra-corporeal thing about this meeting, too. Just now, the Standing Committee also mentioned the government financing platform. We found some problems in the statistics on the operation of data last week, including the introduction of debt, especially the introduction of debt. So this is also I think is also important, ah one is now the regulatory authorities to each commercial bank report data, right? Your dataquality  he is strict control, has strict requirements, ah a problem needs, even to this will be subject to administrative punishment.
02:35:20
    The second one is that it&aposs a political issue, and there must be no new impact or obvious mistakes. Therefore, with the joint efforts of the Corporate Dept and risk management last week, we are gradually straightening out this matter. Of course, because of some problems in the early stage, this is called sedimentation. We used to be a government customer or a government financing platform, right? The definition is not very clear, and the regulators themselves are not very clear. But with this 15th document including the current regulation of some of his rollout of some new requirements, huh? This includes building the system, giving us the CD now, and then we need the system in the future, and these things will gradually become clearer.
02:36:14
    Therefore, our current message is the government financing platform. For this customer, we basically follow the private message, right? That is, the future is a system, as many as we have in the system. This is currently the CD. Ah, give us the disc. If this list is strictly checked, it does not need to be expanded, nor do I think it is necessary to expand it. If it has been expanded, we can adopt it from now on, because every quarter has to be a buffer for a period of time, and we have to adjust it to this private caliber.
02:36:57
    Well, the other thing is that we should never have a problem, but in practice we also found that it&aposs not just the banks, it&aposs not just the banks. There may be some misallocation at the financial or investment side, or the adjustment has not been notified to the banks. This is to require our banks to do a good job of post-loan management in a timely manner, and to detect it in a timely manner, at least to make our situation clear. And to do these so-called hidden debt business that we issued, it&aposs really not one, is it? Don&apost say you are adjusted by others do not know, transfer in also wrong, ah don&apost say inadvertent justice, transfer out, then your repayment source is what? In the future you are falling short, this is also worth guarding, so after-loan management must follow up.
02:37:52
    Ah, so just now we each operating unit, ah, we next step to appropriate control, in addition, all operating units should do a good job of strict post-loan management. The company department (employee ID: risk management) may come to check and provide guidance recently. I hope you will attach great importance to this issue. In particular, the operating units should not act on their own, and we should have a high degree of political sensitivity on this matter. It&aposs not like you have to follow this arrangement with the branch in the first place, but the branch should also follow some of the requirements of the head office including this supervision, right? You can&apost report it or nurture it according to your own understanding, and I&aposd like to explain it again here, OK, I&aposll just say that.
02:38:47
    Okay, so today&aposs theme is a sustainable development of business, because this inclusive customer base and this retail feature have this natural connection, so let me say a few words. Ah, the first one is the inclusive audience, which is partly not individual, but is also an important science of retail. So why do you say that? We have about 2000 universal customers, among which the number of individual universal customers is about 1500,985.
02:39:26
    So there are 800 more than 850 units of the homestead belt, so this is an individual customer, and there are 1000 units of this company. And these inclusive corporate customers are mainly focused on this business owner, such a business exhibition model. So the main person in charge of this business is also an important feature of retail, and we think that the GSP is particularly high-quality customers, and their financial needs are also abundant.
02:40:08
    So just now this resounding in the PPT, the PPT also mentioned that this customer of our homestead belt is now in the retail business aspect of a customer win situation. The current period is 16 million yuan, half of which is in Chengdu. There are a lot of financial management funds. I have looked at the problems of many management organizations. On one hand, we are not particularly good in linkage, but on the other hand, we also reflect our potential of data. This is because the number of inclusive customers continues to grow. If we follow this year&aposs target of 10 billion by the end of the year, our number of inclusive customers may grow to 2,500. If we increase by 5 billion next year, it may reach 35 million.
02:41:01
    So this pattern is still growing at a high speed. Alas, I have heard a lot of business units say that they are not ideal in terms of the source of inclusive customers in bulk, but are our inclusive customers an important source of retail customers in bulk? I think so. Well, in the first half of this year, our retail customers of more than 300,000 have increased by 479. Let&aposs think about it, if some of our 2,000-plus customers can be converted into us, or even some of them can be converted into us. There are more than 300,000 customers, and that&aposs a huge problem.
02:41:46
    Alas, it&aposs imperative that we really clear the boundaries to enhance this contribution. In this case, we need to streamline the boundaries and improve the value. This reflects our integrated operation. Two-way acquisition and two-way acquisition means not only that retail sales will not be obtained in a single line, but also that retail sales will be repeated, and we will push the retail sales of this customer to this inclusive condition. To establish such a linkage mechanism, I think we should establish such a linkage mechanism between the retail department and the small business department. In addition, I think we should come up with the best solution in the near future. We should be able to come up with a coordinated solution to implement it effectively.
02:42:46
    We should promote personnel linkage, business linkage, and information communication. I think it&aposs a tentative idea of a target. If the penetration rate of my inclusive customer base can reach 30%, let&aposs think about it. I&aposm more than 2,000 acres, and this number is growing continuously. Alas, my annual growth rate is also very fast. If the penetration rate reaches 30% and the number of customers with more than 300,000 reaches 10%, I will have 350 customers by the end of next year, which is close to the annual increase of AM.
02:43:30
    So this is one of my ideas. The other solution should be considered: No penalty should be imposed on each other. Hierarchical marketing should be implemented once for one household. In this case, no penalty should be imposed on all customers of this group. The next time, we will talk about promoting products based on the customer&aposs requirements. So, what about hierarchical marketing? We&aposre currently taking a fine-grained management initiative, which is aimed at our team, including our lobby manager, our financial manager, our branch president, and our retail department. After the customer is classified according to the customer&aposs situation, there should be a protection penalty, and then we can push the retail product with a purpose based on the customer&aposs requirements. We can achieve a 30% penetration rate and 10% growth of this customer. Ah, this is our initial vision. Ah, yes, let&aposs talk about it.
02:44:51
    In the first half of the year, by the end of June, overall the company had a good close, I mean 95 billion in corporate deposits. The loan of 80 billion, not more than 10 billion, and the task of inclusiveness is basically to achieve our target, at least to get the head office&aposs target to use the Nanjing method. There are also some differences. In fact, today&aposs last week of communication, I&aposm a large-scale project, and we want to have at least four times with this Huajie, which is different from the four times when we report to me, ah, Monday told me 2,250,000. 21 question on Tuesday, and we were asked about it for 21 days on Thursday.
02:45:32
    Therefore, we really have many problems in the systematic development of Pratt &amp; Whitney business, customer reserve and customer structure. The first point is the target. If the target of 10 billion is 10 billion, then it may not be solved. In fact, I would like to say that the KPI task of the HQ may not be exactly the same as that of the last task. Then I think that no matter what the HQ treats us, as our Nanjing Branch, we have already exceeded US$10 billion in the first place, and we are determined not to move.
02:46:09
    Because from the current structure, if we say that our code is about 84 billion by the end of the year, if we say that our inclusive code is about 10 billion, reasonable response. It also accounts for more than 10 percent of the profits. It&aposs really a very important group for the Nanjing department to improve our structure.
02:46:35
    I want to talk about the development of the whole service business in several aspects. The first is the share of the AVIC project of the branch. Last year, all of our leaders here, we made a judgment and reached a project with a profit of 1 billion yuan and a scale of 1 billion yuan in the whole second half of the year. Just last year, we got the job done without a hitch. So where is our new product this year? But of course we&aposre in public security until now, it&aposs expired this year, we don&apost have it this year, and then we haven&apost seen it yet.
02:47:13
    At the same time, small businesses may need to benchmark. Currently, our Hangzhou branch is doing well on Inclusive-Wide business, which has many core points. For example, through the homestead belt, the value of insurance companies can reach 9000. So a model like this, I think I&aposm a bit older to learn to cooperate with people like this in the market to create something new, this competitiveness. Of course, this year we have new products and policies in the new generation, right? This series for us that I think as a normal Managers of our bank, can&apost wait for the head office, can&apost rely on the head office.
02:47:53
    Now tell the truth at the head office and share the projects in the queue, ah, the whole head office development system development capabilities, ah, ah also may still be relatively clear, if you slow down, others faster, can ensure that the overall performance of the brothers is a leader. So I think we&aposre better than a city with a higher geographical location. This is a health requirement for each step of our project. That is, if the midfield cannot be determined, we must implement this aspect as soon as possible in the second half of the year. Car products. The second thing we can do is to complete this year.
02:48:32
    The second one is how to help our business units in building the entire platform and channel, use their own resources to pay, and wait for customers. Have other places noticed this just now? I think there are still some deviations in the process of listening to everyone&aposs speeches. This year we are the only one underwater, and so far, the homestead has not formed its own channel, so my family has to tell you, secondly, the Yonghua Bridge runs 27 districts. Then I could be wrong.
02:49:08
    On you a marketing personnel in Jiangyin area, you at best 30 channels, do fine do thorough, a total of only a few people? It&aposs impossible for 27 students to do it by relying on the terminal. We need our supervisors to help them meet our needs. I&aposm sure if you&aposre going to have a hard time running, then if you&aposre actually getting 3 channels to do the job, the effect might be a little different. In addition, just now I heard the account manager complaining about the account manager. The channel construction I&aposm also talking about must be good at market behavior and help customers report to you. You can&apost go around and find yourself. After establishing a good channel, how to manage the channel, how to do a good channel, and what kind of output of the channel is our Managers. This is also the management of our branch and should help our operating units to manage it. It is not easy to exceed the account manager.
02:50:11
    For example, how do I feel about this whole product of ours? How can the &quot;Four Ones&quot; project help us to do some work in our product park, especially in the first place, we have opened several times in the south recently, and they have received this under the pretext of this, although the terms of the negotiations are rather harsh. Ah, I guess we&aposre gonna keep working together, huh? Tell us as much as we can about our conditions as we can, and do a little bit. Because they have a large number of customers, because they have a large number of customers in the industry, but they are also willing to do other things, that is, our Bank of Shanghai. Therefore, we have fewer customers and fewer account managers. This is a very good channel for us.
02:51:01
    At the same time, I started the management of the crowd creation, and the process data is very important. Ah, please just Changzhou to talk about the question, is that we are now the third line of loans 5 people starting in a business request. Like the last time I talked to me about this issue, and we&aposre going to talk about it again, I think we&aposre definitely going from the whole small business management aspect, I&aposm going from our account opening, from our partnership, from us to the last series.
02:51:33
    If a business unit has more than 200 households, the success rate is 94,101, and a customer has been working for 20 minutes and 30 minutes, then it may be one for account managers, right? Capacity can&apost be released. How about that? Let&aposs track our optimizations, our strengths, and approvals have them. Yeah. Try to free our clients as much as possible. Finally, we will need to make further sales to track some key projects. On the last day, I tried to get him to get two tickets together, one for $40 million, and there might be problems.
02:52:08
    Therefore, I think this kind of work may still need to be further strengthened in this kind of system work. Oh, come to them on the last day, and they&aposre very hard, and although we&aposre willing to help you get this thing done, although I did my best that day to get this thing done, but as I found myself at that time, the completion rate of 50% is not bad, so if the 90 million can&apost be done again. So that&aposs not the case. Ah, how many orders we put on the last day, the head office small business may be very nervous, that&aposs because everything is a day tomorrow, the difference is four or five billion no problem. business, which is all about the last day, so since we&aposre all working on systems, we talked about a lot of integrated operations just now, and when we turn to integrated management enterprises, how can I talk about these things with you? In the end, I didn&apost finish the job, and I did everything.
02:52:56
    Is how do we lay it out? That&aposs our result, it&aposs a good level of need. Think further. Then, as for our business units, first of all, we have mentioned in this record, some industries with the characteristics of the local government. I think this is the first one I want to talk about today. Every region, no matter Nantong, Wuxi, Changzhou, must have some problems of their own. According to our model of borrowing products, I also hope that you will strengthen education and research on the types of products. What are the local peers doing? The local government has good products.
02:53:39
    I&aposd like to go to the provinces to study which products may have problems, so that we can ask them to do the work together, and I&aposll stress that. This is our own branch leadership beautiful scenery or performance. The second one is to agree with our peers to make these products. If we can&apost develop ideas for a small business in the early stage, I&aposll go to the head office, and the head office is the head office. Currently, there&aposs still some distance between these products. But this product is also being updated, and once this product is finalized, how can we keep up with it? We bring out the features of our Bank of Shanghai.
02:54:38
    And why someone else has it, I don&apost know. Just imagine. Let us think about a few more questions. First, I think I have a good customer base. If I have a good production capacity, why do I have the same expectation? Have we gone to do something? Or is our Managers business operation to take account managers to run? I&aposll tell you whether the follow-up tracking and management help to identify problems?
02:55:14
    The second is that what about this large holding of the big guaranty company? What kind of product do we use instead? You can send it. We see that many code companies use this rate of 20 percent, and many code company users approve so many things, how to apply it? Try to use our products. If the traditional way of recommending them for guarantee is the same as the one mentioned by the Minister of Nantong just now, that is, the guarantee company business may not have any problem. How can we replace it with Xinqiang? The ticket can be brought or not, anyway you just can&apost issue a charge ticket, also my bank card that day.
02:55:51
    Does the original Defence have anything to add? No. In the commercial industry, if there are any requirements for the government to go to the business with vouchers, we should always use our minds and write down our data to see whether there are supply chain core customers and whether there are crimes. Our pan-core supply chain, I don&apost know what the head office is like, how the state-owned enterprises or provincial-level state-owned subsidiaries form their own business thoughts. For example, we have done a lot of work in the government&aposs business of Bank of Shanghai. If I have just read some lines that say a campus is reserved for the second half of this year, we only want to build 30 million and 50 million. I think this is another requirement, a large number of continuous enterprises. A lot of it is that if it is our branch president who surrounds our secondary branch, if we can spend half a month running two campuses and three campuses, I don&apost want to be more than 500 yuan.
02:56:56
    The point is to think that I really want to do this. Then we have the leader vacation. I believe that we can do this in the campus. I&aposm very anxious to think about how much money has been spent on this cloud security mission in the second half of the year, which cost one billion dollars. This product is harmonious, isn&apost it? The goal.
02:57:24
    So far, how do we break it down, how do we do it, and then maybe focus more on it. That&aposs not to say that every business unit has all its online and offline products, right? I hope you can focus on a little bit and follow your own characteristics. However, the online and offline markets do not represent all the online and offline products. He has so many human and material resources, which is the same as the poker channel just mentioned, right? There are 27 districts, I a twenty-odd tons, a twenty-odd tons, that if not, we will not do one by one department, I this Nanjing real estate is similar, the sum is almost the same.
02:58:04
    June 27th is a kind of exploitation by a law enforcement officer, focusing on some of our limited energy. After thinking about these questions, let&aposs see if these structures are sustainable. So these business are sitting here this year, and they&aposll be able to do it next year, er, next year? One more thing tomorrow, don&apost underestimate the determination to transform the branch.
02:58:28
    Ah, to be honest, 79 gave this to the government at the end of June. If I put this on, the job is done. Okay. Thank you. So as we talked about a lot of inclusiveness business, we&aposd rather be a real-life financial media perspective. We still hope to see how many of the businesss are in the future. We may share some information in the whole management process. You will talk about the team building.
02:59:09
    Today, the building of the Inclusive Account Manager team is also an important topic for the head office managers. The head office has about 400 employees. Nanjing Public Security Bureau you want to add 15 10 15 legal affairs, can 23 to 18 when, to 18 households, see the second-level branch currently requires two persons each, right? 11 September. I think the first attitude problem is that some branches have not moved, and I think they have not been completed. How many defects are there? Some, some 20 squares, yes. If you have a full-time account manager, you just have to talk about what I&aposm talking about later, who&aposs in charge of these inclusive account managers? Some tier-2 branches put it in business, but from the perspective of the Bank of Shanghai mechanism, many business departments are re-organizing, so I hope to do this here. Online businesses may also consider this issue, so I will not consider this issue for the time being.
03:00:15
    Then I may but I think the organization may be inclusive account managers are all two rooms, one is professional, the second is the work style, and some operations. Therefore, it is reasonable to say what department do you belong to these customers? Now, it is more likely that those who are managed by business or the marketing department are managed by the Business Management Department. Ah, so at least we have the condition to manage quality. The second is to build channels for all-inclusive personnel. Who is going to take care of this? I think at the secondary branch level, where do the members of the law enforcement party come from at least? In terms of channel construction. Don&apost let the account manager do it, go through the channel. So I visited the Bank of Shanghai to talk about marketing. So I decided all the investment at the beginning of the year in Tianjin. However, I think we must solve a gunpoint problem in channel construction here, including the Managers requirement of the business unit, so that our account managers can have a target, instead of saying that our account managers are going to run. That&aposs your mission.
03:01:19
    So we&aposve seen 131,190 of our average account managers this year, and 900,000 of our lowest under construction. 65. This is the same, not impossible. Level 2 branches: Two account managers in some level 2 branches are basically 8 or 9 million. Many account managers are selling. Through your thinking, this is a single pressure, more than one hour must have a problem. If it takes half a year and one of my account managers only spends eight or nine million dollars, this must be the problem. What&aposs the problem? This may mean that Managers of our business units should think about problems. What do we do in process management and what do we help customers solve in appraisal? What did you find? Then we talk about performance appraisal. After we build this team, we may share our customers again. If we have some original effects or inefficient personal management, we can teach us how to serve our customers.
03:02:24
    At the same time, we put together some cases with potential, so extension management is very good. We made an inclusive customer, and then we found an inclusive customer, and then the FX specialist based on this investment, and then I found out that it had some settlement. We&aposve done this for Bank of Shanghai to connect to foreign exchange products. Finally, we&aposve calculated this as a cross-border RMB 400 million a year. So that means our Inclusive customers, they&aposre going to do a topic, and we&aposre going to open up from point to point, right? From a financial customer, for example, CNY400 million cross-border, it is possible to take a look at the current domains. Our effective account is only 38.22%, and the assets are within CNY500,000. There are still a lot of work worth our time.
03:03:16
    The last chapter I want to talk about is the service business, which is a big article about small customers and the inclusive service business. As long as we continue to persevere, cultivate, and pursue, our leaders will also leave. So this year, our Nanjing Branch will be able to complete more than 10 billion education in our country. Now I&aposve spent half a day this afternoon focusing on inclusive sustainability.
03:03:49
    I just saw the second direction of our department and made a good speech. Well, I think it&aposs true that we&aposve done some serious thinking. And our three presidents have made some arrangements from their own perspective. Ah, I&aposll just say three sentences. The first one I think is my personal experience of doing work, I think it&aposs thousands of other things, but we say two horizontals, one vertical is one word. Ah, actually, I see many, many of us, that is, we in the actual work, do we all have such a feeling? Some people say that when we reach 10, when we reach 50, it&aposs true. My goal is to go a little higher. Alas, the actual implementation, as we mentioned just now, includes channel construction, and maybe the expansion of business. We have a reserve for this project last year, and I remember that my participation in this company&aposs projects will not exceed $20 billion, but we haven&apost been in place for two months, and sometimes we can&apost tell stories about ourselves. Ah, we have the same problem now. We also talk about the development of business. We don&apost need to talk so much about this. We really do one project by one, one thing by one, and one thing by one. It&aposs not so profound. There&aposs the biggest gap between people. I think the first one is the landscape and the second one is the era.
03:05:35
    Don&apost think of this as so mysterious, ah, we also include our pattern inside, actually to us a cognitive thinking. The second sentence is that I also hope that we will benefit the development of business. I hope that everyone in the bank will speak with each other through exchanges. Although I hope that we can inspire together, there are some things, one is not to take a single path. Well, we have to adjust a little bit more. What&aposs that I&aposve always hated? We should say that if we talk about not, ah, it&aposs just what homestead Nanjing area can&apost go anywhere.
03:06:19
    Ah, some of us may just sit here, ah, because that&aposs certainly not going to go down. So if we make a bill now, where is it? Then let&aposs push the rules for the whole industry, and I think this road is as simple as that. Ah, each of our lines is actually wide, and the key is that each line you have to explore according to your characteristics. The second one, I think, is that we should not take the path of mind-fixing, ah, do not take the wrong path of illegal operation.
03:06:56
    Well, why are you telling everyone that? I&aposve read a group of speeches just now. When we encounter problems, we have a bit of a solid mindset. When we talk about approval, we talk about more of our prices. In fact, we&aposre in the market, because we really feel that I&aposm not as good as others. People aren&apost as good as me. Our Bank of Shanghai products are certainly not the best in the market, but we have a lot of products that others can&apost expect.
03:07:36
    Ah, you include the agricultural paper loans we&aposre doing now, ah, there may be some lines of innovation that outstrips us to some extent. When we were able to make it, weren&apost we also ahead of the curve? Are we going to study this market seriously, ah when talking about the price, that price is a lot, then Ningbo Bank of business how to develop? We didn&apost align with Bank of Ningbo, and he didn&apost change the benchmark. We&aposre not aligning with Bank of Ningbo now, right? You Ningbo Bank to look at the number of Ningbo Bank.
03:08:21
    Alas, so let&aposs take a look at what we&aposre talking about when we have a problem. There is an old survey that we certainly still have, but we need to see that everyone is still making progress in the run-in, including our grass-roots and departments. Ah, I don&apost think so now. This is the core issue, and the price is the same. At our price, we have our customers, Suzhou Branch, Suzhou Branch of Bank of Shanghai, and now a homestead of 6 billion, and the same products of Nanjing Branch. We are the same products developed by the head office, the same price, the price in Suzhou is lower than the price in our city, but why do we have this situation? Let&aposs not give ourselves steps.
03:09:21
    We made our own homestead belt of 100 million, or we talked to the Suzhou branch, so I hope you have a look, there is a standard why the operation is illegal? We are doing inclusive benefits. Last time I remember I said at a meeting in May that I would like you to do inclusive benefits. Ah, so a lot of this inclusive treatment at the end of June may have been approved by the end of June. At the end of June, I firmly disagree. I don&apost want such figures. I want all of us to start with leader and correct our thinking. Have you seriously thought about how you can achieve inclusive benefits in your business? So what do we want everyone to do? We have to dare to take the initiative and be the first to innovate? We have opportunities for innovation. Bank of Shanghai I think there are too many opportunities for innovation. Ah, but how do we get to the front? Our notes from last year, including through this year, are now priced on average, which is above the market average.
03:10:49
    We want you to tell you now, we can&apost take away the bills in this area, we don&apost ask for distributions, and the bills are not only in government financing, there&aposs a lot of manufacturing, a lot of other businesses, but we&aposve talked about it for a few years in each area. Our professional market and Changzhou have also seen Nantong this professional market should actually say that there is a big space, but how do we discuss the linkage of retail in our professional market and how do we break through this? Including our park treasure, the whole bank may be doing a little longer now, Wuxi basically has one or two bags, others basically zero. For example, when we talk about bringing in our bills, we can&apost do bills in this place, so I don&apost think anyone wants you to do bills. It&aposs not easy to make bills, you can make bills, you can do whatever you want. We must have room for survival in every place. So why do we have to have financial departments in each bank and target the same industry? We won&apost put forward some unrealistic requirements for everyone.
03:12:11
    I hope the whole bank will make further efforts. The past is that we have zeroed in the first half of the year, and we should start from the beginning with the target we have set ourselves for the first half of the year to increase deposits and loans, double north and double departments. This is a commitment we made in the head office, which we never thought of in the past. Ah, we achieved such a goal. Ah, thanks to the efforts of the whole bank in the first half of the year, Ah, we should fully affirm our banks, our secondary branches have been in the forefront of the whole bank, some of our Nanjing sub-branches have also made great progress this year, ah, we did not think in the past, we achieved such a goal, what do you think of such a goal? Alas, I don&apost think it&aposs easy, but the request from the head office is that the head office thinks that the target is Bank of Jiangsu and the target is the head office of Bank of Nanjing, so we&aposre not changing all our banks and all our branches now. Benchmark with the local Jiangsu Bank, Nanjing Bank. Now the head office&aposs request is that we should see Jiangbei Bank Nanjing Bank, which is where we are now in Jiangsu. How can we develop better? Ah proposed better ah, so I hope our secondary branches benchmark with local peers, ah is always a pursuit of us.
03:13:53
    So why would I just like to report that we have a decline in the proportion of artists, a decline in the proportion of one person, our loans, the middle and second half of the second half of the year, the head office stressed a lot, and we&aposre in the third quarter, I think the company&aposs conditions will give this indicator to you recently. Including retail mortgages will also give a strong signal. What kind of answer do we call in the third quarter? Ah, I think the third quarter profit loan is a standard to meet the pressure.
03:14:33
    Generally speaking, we have just said that our revenue growth in the first half of the year is only 3.6%. If we look at our indicators to see whether the growth in our revenue is mainly due to our poor performance, which is called the decrease in interest-bearing assets. Today I see the annual report of our listed banks, today I see two, one is Hangzhou Bank, one is Nanjing Bank, right? Bank of Jiangsu is all 16, all 16 15 16. In particular, let&aposs look at the most frightening figures of the Bank of Ningbo. The Bank of Ningbo&aposs final loans have increased by more than 30 billion yuan, and the total loans to the public have increased by more than 30 billion yuan, and the total deposits have increased by 1900. So let&aposs also take a look. It is that every line may see local ah or there are some that is what this means, we are not different from you, ah to tell the truth, I did not ask our Ningbo Bank to go, ah, but see what? The market is there room.
03:15:51
    With this growth this year, the deposits of the Bank of Jiangsu increased by 1,200 in the first half of the year, the Bank of Ningbo was embezzling 190 billion, and the Bank of Nanjing was also over 100 billion. Actually, the number of each bank is over 100 billion. Let&aposs take a look at each region. We have to find a direction. We have always said that sometimes we have to study the market, study our peers, and know what the peers are doing. We have not studied in a standard way, and even if we can&apost innovate, we learn from what you, for example, Wuxi Branch, should have mentioned. Ning WDM line, Ningbo Bank in Wuxi more than 5000 customers, just how many customers? 1900. A few thousand.
03:16:41
    That&aposs so much load, so let&aposs learn. I think innovation starts from Wuxi. We&aposll implement such a product in Wuxi. Wuxi should have such a determination. We need to investigate and promote it together. Ah, so I said that in July, we may hold the meeting in the first half of the year, it is estimated that it will be until the beginning of August or the end of July. It is more likely that the meeting will be in the beginning of August. Let&aposs go to different lines, because today we have only made some exchanges and speeches on the general terms.
03:17:20
    So this morning, the head office and all the business conditions have made some exchanges and speeches. Generally speaking, the head office requested to attend the meeting. Today, all our department managers attended the meeting. He said that there was no management department, regardless of whether the manager of the management department attended the meeting, what do you feel? There is no reason to speak of it. There are only two words to develop. If we can&apost develop, we can&apost. Well, that&aposs all for today&aposs meeting. Yeah.
